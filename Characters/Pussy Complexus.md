Philosopher-pimp: a wheeled jar of ceramic cat brains

Formerly Jaeger, now know as Pussy Complexus, PC travelled to the outskirts of [[Golo]] from [[The Violet City]] by way of [[The Palace of Light]]. Comprised of 13 cat brains and 26 cat eyes floating in an unnamed aqueous solution on an all-terrain chassis, they were banished from [[The Violet City]] for being heretics. They are gifted biomances experimenting on human bodies, trying to enhance them. The bodies were given freely by their followers, but it seemed to rub some the wrong way. They passed through [[The Palace of LIght]] to gather more husks for enhancement.

Pussy Complexus believes whole heartedly in their pursuit and thinks human trafficking and necromancy are abominations. There is a distinct moral compass surrounding its use of bodies... "It would be a terrible waste". They have lined the husks with vomish wiring and transplanted [[symbiotes]] to create the [[Courtesans]].

It was following their meeting with [[The Caravan]] that Jaeger was ejected from its role as leader (and member of the community). And thus their numbers dropped to 12 cat brains but they kept the extra eyes.

#### Extract:
`Jaeger drives to the edge of the precipice and thinks for a while. Eventually Spider Mendel goes over to chat with him. Afterwards the device ejects a brain onto the ground. It then drives back over and informs us that Jaeger is no longer representing them. They no longer have a single entity speaking for them. They are now an autonomous collective to be acknowledged as Pussy Complexus.`

Following the [[Revolution of Golo]] Pussy Complexus was found in their [[Just Like the Real Thing|shop]] with their tires popped and glass dome broken, blackened, and melted. The brains and eyes were being cooked and served to paying customers by the [[Courtesans]]. Though never confirmed, [[The Caravan]] gathered that [[Gulek]] had come by and freed [[Barrol]] uplifting the [[Courtesans]] in the process giving them the power of communication through a combination of his electrical powers and the sentient words from [[The Last Story Tree]].
