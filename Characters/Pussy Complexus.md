Philosopher-pimp: a wheeled jar of ceramic cat brains

Jaeger drives to the edge of the precipice and thinks for a while. Eventually [[Mendel]] goes over to chat with him. Afterwards the device ejects a brain onto the ground. It then drives back over and informs us that Jaeger is no longer representing them. They no longer have a single entity speaking for them. They now want to be acknowledged as Pussy Complexus
