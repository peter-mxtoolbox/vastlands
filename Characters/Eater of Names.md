![[Eater of Names.png]]

Not much is known about the Eater of Names. Her origins, physiology, and motives are largely a mystery. The one thing that is known is her desire to consume and be consumed. 

She is at the head of a gourmand cult based out of [[The Last Drop]] in [[Golo]]. She is very formal and approaches eating with the solemnity most reserve for religious rites and ceremonies. She takes this shit very seriously. 

[[Grosnic]] first encountered her during an undergroud supper club. Having ordered something rare and exotic off menu, it gained him a seat at her table where he impressed her with his appetite. It was through this meeting that the rest of the Caravan were granted an audience with her to potentially become our patron in a new endeavour to be travelling gourmands.

During the [[Dinner with the Eater of Names]], [[Siljak]] won her favor and was chosen to be the vessel to transport a piece of her to the [[Holy Mountain]].

She wants to be consumed by a God.
