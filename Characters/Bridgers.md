We learn in [[Meeting the Bridgers]] that they are sometimes referred to as blockheads. They also wield giant shotguns as large as a normal person.

Following the revolution, they are headed back into the [[Golon Sea]] to do some prospecting. They sold one of their shotguns to some of the rat people that we encountered.
