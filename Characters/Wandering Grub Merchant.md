![[Wandering Grub Merchant.png]]

The Wandering Grub Merchant is a travelling merchant first discovered in the [[Black Oasis]].

Comprised of a teeming mass of worms inside a large mechanized suit, the Grub Merchant stands 12' tall and weighs over a tonne[^1]. 

Its cylindrical body is in sections that can rotate independently of each other. On its rear is a vent that emits a scent that ties in to its disposition. It is a generally pleasant scent to attract buyers and put them at ease. However, if perturbed, it will emit a noxious scent to show its discontent. It carries a staff that it will stick into the ground and light up to indicate it is ready for business. With a wave of its hand, it can summon rare items that will appear on a woven rug for trade.

In addition to communication via scents from vents, it issues audible mechanical sounds, ranging from robotic purrs to garbage disposal with a spoon in it.
