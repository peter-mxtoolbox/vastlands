![[Bozin Black Portrait.png]]

Owns and lives in [[Mothers Milk]], a club near the hollows.

Bozin is [[Tessana]]'s father, despite being younger than her. 

He is a disgraced Yellow City Scion

He is said to have amazing taste in art and a serious fucking drug problem.  While he has expensive tastes, expensive doesn't always translate to refined. His club and likewise his quarters are filled with garrish and gaudy furnishings that do not match but reek of the money spent on them. His prized possessions are a collection of toupee's from all over the V A S T L A N D S. Some of them are sentient and all are kept in gilded cages around his quarters. The quiver and if you get close enough to some you can hear an audible cooing.

During the [[2021-09-21 Revolution of Golo]], Bozin chose not to take sides and his actions would not be forgiven. The [[Mothers Milk]] was ransacked and vandalized. Most notably "Coward" had been carved into the wall behind the stage. Now scabbed over, it was his final epitaph.

The exact details of his death are unknown, but his body was found barricaded in his office with an apparent self inflicted gunshot wound to the head. His trademark "Bonbon" head covering was shattered and his brain matter was spread across the velvet cover of the [[Nightmare Portrait]] behind his desk.

Found among the clutter in his milky grave was a small black box containing an elegant spyglass of filigreed ebony with a bio mechanical roving eye on one end. It occasionally stares at something that doesn't appear to be there.
