Raskala comes along with Saito to the Torture Theater. 

There is a ledger I have to balance out. I was looking for a portrait of the Cyan Sea. We went looking for Nightmare Portrait and found Bozeman Black’s accounting ledger.

  

At the entrance to the TT. Giant arch over the entry “Cruelty is the Muse”. There is an ornate door, riveted. There’s like a giant hubcap sized distorted face in the center. Sort of like a lion’s mane with a man’s face and shark teeth. At the very back there is a keyhole. 

  

I’m going to try to pick the lock (13) with my butterfly knife. Knife carved from the wings of an obsidian butterfly. The knife melts the inner workings of the lock and the face turns into the “sad face” theater mask. The door opens.

  

The TT is a 360 degree sunken stage with rings all around it. There are “lights” that are glass enclosures filled with “mites” that emit light. Most are very dim and dark. The stage is not very well lit. 

In the rafters there are chains and “instruments of torture”. There are gossamer curtains moving around up above as well. 

  

There is a crumpled form on the stage. All the set dressing is also suspended. 

  

Saito approaches the stage. It is ghostly silent in the theater. There is a thick layer of dust everywhere. It must not have been used in a very long time. He jumps into the pit. 

  

There is a crumpled skeleton wearing a robe that is familiar to me. It’s Master Malcom’s robes. It’s all desiccated. 

  

I am puzzled and feel compelled to open the Bosin Black books. I look for the symbols from his hat. They are associated with slave trade legder entries. It used to be many types of slaves. Then there was a shift towards almost exclusively Ratlings. Many, many ratlings. I was sent out to “fix” the problem here that they are not doing an equal opportunity slave trade. 

  

Eater of Names tongue hunt - slave trade for ratlings. Rasklana needs to witness what is about to happen. She helps me out of the pit, but as I climb up,  I see up in the rafters, peering down, a ratcatcher who jumps down at us. I let go and fall back into the pit. 

  

It has four legs and four arms. It strikes a pose trying to look cool. They used to be in arenas fighting threats, but with no threats they are become entertainers. 

  

I sheath my sword and take out my butterfly. 1 + 1 (+2). He sweeps with a sword I and I go to parry, but i have a knife not a sword. The knife is shattered like glass. (4dmg). I pully my sword. I parry the attack but he wrenches apart the abacus sword (1dmg) I raise the book to deflect the last attack (2dmg)

  

Military melee weapon - a Cavalry Sabre. I roll away and a pull the sword through the pages of the book. I then make three small cuts on my forearm. I hit all four swords and it is amazed at my swords skills. It drops two swords.

  

It attacks. It hasn’t had an actual opponent for so long. I parry and it rushes past. I stab it from the side and pull my blade out, it’s work done a mortal wound has been struck.

  

It pulls down it’s mask. It was a Porcelain prince. There is a creature, now alone after being part of the hive mind for so long. All the emotions. 

  

I give Rasklana one of the shorter swords and she pulls me out of the pit. She fan-girls because of the performance. 

  

Saito meditates and engages the Aural Corona which creates a zone of silence that they cannot be heard from but they cannot hear out of. 

  

We start looking for somebody in charge. We see on the ground a thick glistening clotted trail of pinking slime. We don't think this is penis pool slime thank god. But it is disgusting. It’s 2 or 3 feet wide. Saito is looking for any signs of any position of power or management to deliver his message. We follow the trail of slime. It must be from some wounded.. Thing. 

  

We round the corner. Dammit, It is a penis monster towering over a ratling slave. On the other side of the corridor there is a sign with to the arena with an icon of a flail and an axe. Saito attacks the monster. 

  

Saito stabs the monster and it is no longer towering but is not slithering on the ground and it turns its attention toward us. The slave trips over a cart as it scrabbles away. 

  

He attacks again but…in it’s thrashing convulsions it’s horrible bloody stump hits the slave and it drowns before we can save it. As it is dying I pull off its helmet. It is very old.  He mutters, “Please don’t” 

  

We search his dead body for any clue towards management. Under his slaves robes he’s wearing an ornate satin garment with detailed stitching. He also has a porcelain eye filled with poems. 

  

This poem is also about death

  

Wherever we shed our blood

That’s where we put down roots

Whenever they murdered us

Our graves became our churches

We are our own sacrifices

  

She also finds on a leather cord, a small silver whistle in the shape of an ivory antlered elephantine beast. There was also a cart / gurney thing with another body that has fallen to the floor. The slave must have been pushing this when he was attacked by the creature.  It is an unmasked naked body of a human. It has insane neck muscles that they exercise because that is the only part of their body that they expose to each other. They are very vain.  The body is in rigor mortis in an state of abject terror. Otherwise there are no marks of violence.

  

We head towards the arena. We are in a hallway approaching the arena and we can see the arena through an arch. We see a bright crystalline white glow coming from there. We recognize a silencing effect present. 

  

Saito embiggens his cube and they ride it into the arena. The stands have people in them observing, all of them masked. There is a dazzling light show. There is a thread of light coming down from the top of the dome, some sort of penthouse at the apex. The threads are like fiber optic roots / filaments. Each thread ends at a revelors mask. The eye sockets emit a brilliant light.

  

There is a lattice of hard light that seems solid enough to stand on. Once the silence lifts, we hear a cacophony of screaming and pain. 

  

“Where is the master of this house?” 

  
There is a balcony at the far end of the arena. Another Master Malcom stands on it and says “You wish to meet the master of this house? And you shall. For the only true master is death.”

  

Two rat catchers come out. 

  

Saito shouts, “The Ziggurat of Reclamation will not stand for this breach of contract.”

  

Master Malcom is enraged. He points at Saito and says, “Slaver Scum. The only thing you reap this day is justice. And this justice is blind.”

  

“FOOL! I know your TRUE master all too well. Somehow he has retraced his bloody footprints back to this place, but he will NEVER reclaim what he lost! How fitting that you cannot see that, for justice is also blind!“

  

The rat catchers disappear from sight. 

  

He sheaths his sword and puts his hands out and activates Navigator of other Worlds to sense an idea of where they might be. He pulls his sword. The rat catchers appear to him as voids amongst the background of all the other souls. There is a vortex converging on the central top. 

  

He falls to one knee as though he is hurt. He attacks to the left. There is a savage exchange.

  

He stands over me and tells me that I have lost. Saito tells him that he killed him before the fight ever started. My blade was poisoned. As I pulled it through the book, I transferred the poison to the blade. 

  

The third rat catcher comes over to deal my death blow. He takes Saito’s head off and then licks the blade. He raises the head up to show the arena to show the head off. He then falls dead poisoned.**
