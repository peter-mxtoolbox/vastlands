#### 2022-01-17 Mendel Solo Mission

We need intel on how to get into the palace.

-   Mendel has limited invisibility capabilities (when near the light of the wall surrounding the Palace of Light).
    
-   Mendel's mission is to find a way to get inside.
    

  

Mendel circles the palace looking for vulnerabilities

-   hears music and debauchery beyond the wall. periodically punctuated by agonizing sounds. it's a party.
    
-   The wall is made of something really dangerous, what is it?
    

-   The wall sucks soul energy out of people. Literally sucks their color. The soul energy in this joint is unreal. Intensely powerful inside. The sacrifices made within the walls are what powers the Palace.
    

-   There is a race/type of being that is similar to Mendel in that they can get close to the wall. They aren't human, but they are sentient, like Mendel. They are called The Colorless. There's something about the wall that's comforting and it gives them a wee bit of protection.
    
-   The Palace Improper - A chintzy version for those that aren't prepared for the palace proper. Palace-lite. There is an apartment/vantage point atop this place.
    

-   There is a cacophony around here. Between the Party Beast and the Palace itself, it's loud. During the lull Mendel can hear a crystalline chime like music coming from above the Palace Improper.
    
-   Mendel is going to climb to the top. They pass by a window covered in fog/smoke.
    

-   See Art Asset (Dude smoking a hookah through his neck)
    

-   These dudes are smoking something. From their overheard conversation Mendel can discern:
    

-   They are highwaymen/bandits on an escort mission delivering someone from CloudHenge to the palace as punishment. While most people come here to join the Unity 100, for this person, it is the worst thing that could happen.
    

-   Mendel continues to the top and peeps over the edge. When they get closer, the music is so delicate and symphonic, very complex & hypnotic.
    
-   A person is here on their own staring into the distance manipulating the air and this structure.
    

-   See Art Asset Ingo -- Figure with pink eyes with crystals coming from their head.
    

-   The image is literal. The crystals move and shift and music comes from it. The person is aware of Mendel, but doesn't care and continues to play. They are unthreatened. When finished the crystals wink back into their head.
    
-   They ask, "What did you think of the performance?"
    

-   Mendel attempts to respond with Rahzel like music and compliments attempting to recreate the music while simultaneously complimenting its beauty. The sentiment is appreciated, even though Mendel doesn't quite nail the performance. Mendel notes: "My instrument is still rather new to me myself."
    

-   The person is fascinated by Mendel being a "living instrument". It is both literal and metaphorical. They ask about what other songs does this "instrument" perform? Mendel responds: "This is best suited for movement and death." The person is not alarmed, "The sword sings its own song and those that wield it perhaps sing with less enthusiasm."
    

-   The person is Ingo, literally means Pet. They were touched by God, literally.
    
-   Mendel asks... from The Holy Mountain? Yes.
    
-   Ingo explains the God on the Holy Mountain is in pieces. It's not one cohesive being. Shattered. Wholeness vs. Scattered. 
    

-   We're talking theology, all the Near Gods that stalk the world are part of a single greater God. When it exploded it created a pantheon of Near Gods.
    
-   They think this U-God was exploded atop the Holy Mountain.
    
-   Ingo is convinced that when touched (literally) by God a connection was created with the U-God atop the mountain. Trickle down deism. The near God's name is a chord. As we talk, she is manifesting shapes out of her head and they are illustrating the story she is telling. But we'll call the God Dminor7 for short.
    
-   Mendel tells Ingo about the azurite stone and their fractured existence. Ingo says this is all the same we are all fragments seeking unity.
    

-   Ingo offers Mendel a drink. A clear liquid in a clear decanter. Exotic special water. It is literally a cloud from Cloud Henge. There is a stopper that she pulls and the cloud rises and she shotguns it into Mendel's face. Mendel condensates on the interior. The whole thing is rather intimate.
    
-   This is a complex emotional place for Ingo. Ingo was a slave... a pet to a non-human thing. So coming back here is awkward and conflicting. She can perceive the light coming off the Palace and is inspired by it. It unlocks creativity. Even though it is derived from the pain that comes from inside. She intimates, with some difficultly, that there is something about the spectrum of suffering that is different from what she expected.
    

-   She expected the Hellraiser style pain/pleasure dynamic, but that is not quite right. It is pain that lights the place up. There is a focal point. A prism. It's like every note being played at once. It's difficult to describe. She puts up her hand... "it's happening."
    
-   A quiet falls over the city. A hushed anticipation. The light of the palace literally dims for a moment, then the entirety is a crystal clear white flash for a moment. Everyone notices and goes nuts. Folks yelling and guns going off. Then the revelry resumes. "They've just killed another one."
    
-   Through careful concentration Ingo can project these complex things from their head. It is Hard Light and can be used as a weapon. 
    
-   Idea: Project hard light into Mendel to bend light and/or disperse it. 
    
-   NOTE: Ingo touched by God, Mendel touched by Demon. Two sides of the same coin.
    

-   When the Light flashes, it creates a vulnerability in the wall. There is 1 minute window when Mendel can interact with the wall and allow the party to interact around it safely.
    

-   Mendel could push people over.
    
-   Maybe have a hard light gun shoot Mendel, who disperses it to create openings in the wall.
    
-   Hard light zip line with Mendel being the balloon that carries friends over.
    
-   Web protection for humans.
    

-   Sin Eater: still creepin'
    

-   Mendel is incognito. Somewhere between the Trading Stalls & Sin Eater, Mendel sees a fish.
    

-   A fish is hanging in the air and it sees Mendel. A long nose, misshapen fish with weird pits in its eyes. It's watching Mendel. It flicks its tail and moves on passing through walls in Nomad's Land. 
    

-   There are a ton of spikes, blades, brushes for scraping mud off different types of feet. Foot cleanliness is important here.
    
-   Inside there is a fine zen garden style sand. Its really dark. The only light is from a chair in the middle of the yurt. It is at a right angle to the door. There are 3 people inside. There are two identical twins sitting on the illuminated chair.
    

-   ** See Assets **
    

-   The twins are arguing with the Sin Eater.
    
-   The Sin Eater pulls away the mask. They appear to have been human but are wasting away; wrinkled and strange with unblinking lidless eyes. The Sin Eater says, "I can't do this for the both of you." The twins talk in loud birdlike shrieks. "We are one and the same. His sin is my sin!" The Sin Eater relents and starts setting up a device with an iris and looks like a Vogt Kampf test.
    
-   Mendel beckons the fish outside. S! The fish is attracted to Mendel... because they're novel, but also because of where they have been. Specifically something picked up through interaction with the Black Oasis. The fish is looking for Mendel's shadow, but Mendel does't cast one. 
    
-   It is a Void Fish. Mendel has enticed the fish to hang out inside them. It is now an unreliable void fish. It acts as though unstuck in time like Billy Pilgrim. Agatha was mostly in control when this happened. The other aspects of Mendel are unified in hating this.
    
-   NOTE: Mendel's behavior is much more erratic now with proximity to the stone. Mendel knows the end is near.
    
-   There is a flash of light from the Sin Eater's place and the twins come out and return to their trading stalls. One of them literally rattles a cage of a slave. They have ornate finger jewelry on the tips of their fingers.
    

-   Trading Places: Slave auction
    
-   Carousing:
    

-   $800 - 5 - Attend a raucous Sun-Taur sex show, inadvertently save the life of an Iron Lung outlaw gang master (vaping guy from the Palace Improper) endearing myself to the entire gang. His name is King Abrasion. Iron Lung are mercenaries in service to the high vape lord of Cloud Henge. The Vape Lord has paid a fortune to send the self denying acetic hermit, Donkey Man, to the palace of light as ironic punishment. Their appointment is tomorrow morning. Mendel has been pledged a life debt by King Abrasion. His gang, The Vaper's Dozen is 13 guys (King + 12). These dudes are maniacs. Dangerous as shit. Violent marauders. Fucking savages. These dudes are Fist of the North Star crazy.
    
-   How did I save their life? 
    
-   Their keyword is: weird about food. Could be a way to get them to join the team? They vape their food and we can convince them of another way by introducing them to the delights of food.
