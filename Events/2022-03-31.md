Goat: Sha Tu / Shea

  

Rasklana puts a hand on Garland’s shoulder, and another on her heart. “You are the strangest person I have ever met, but thank you for saving my life.”

“You gave me an opportunity to use these flares. These are good flares. I’d buy them again.”

  

There is a strang intensity with Saito as he tells the group that he has to go check out this Torture Theater. Rasklana reacts somewhat as well and says she’s going with him.

  

The Reveler’s Suites

The layout of this wing is very discombobulated. It’s easy to become disoriented. There are bas-relief carvings of people on journeys as the demarcation between the palace and the suites. It is very quiet. Garland starts doing some cupped clapping to try to detect any sort of magical sound suppression. There does not appear to be anything like that. It’s just really quiet here.

  

Garland looks around for any more glyphs or sigils. There are some tiles low to the ground around 2-3 feet off the ground. There is like a goblet, some food, and like a bed along with some language written but none of us can read it. There are some similarities to the poems found in the grates outside. 

  

Sha Tu ponders if perhaps this palace once belonged to the Rat people. Garland thinks that perhaps these icons are for the ratlings that are illiterate. 

  

It appears after investigation that these apartments are totally empty. They may have been here long ago, but there are no signs of recent life. We see clothing and food that are abandoned. 

  

Some rooms have an alcove with a mirror and a table. There is blood splatter on the mirror. 

  

Saito smells fresh coffee being brewed. Good coffee. This smells like coffee from the Golan sea. The team searches for the source of the coffee smell. They hear a clatter. Then it is quiet again. They see an inhabited suite. It appears more classy than the other areas. There is a fancy coffee brewing setup and fresh pot of coffee. There are bags of coffee all with the eye glyph. 

  

-   There is a table set up in front of the fire with a game on it
    
-   In the corner there is something large (6ft x 6ft block) that is covered up with a rich velvet curtain. 
    
-   There are several little doorways with like gossamer type curtains that lead off of this place
    
-   There is also a rack that is knocked over (curtain down) and on the ground we see several firearms that are of a style that are not familiar along with shell casings on the ground. 
    

  

Garland drinks some of the coffee. The cups are really small. There are two firearms missing. 

  

Sha Tu calls out for anybody hiding to come out. They hear a weird combination of revelry and people enjoying themselves that comes like a wave and then recedes away with something like a doppler effect. Garland picks up the baby guns. They are tiny and will expend their entire magazine in a single burst. 

  

[[Spider Mendel]] is pulls the covers off the thing in the corner. There is a pallet of very rare honeybone broth (x16)

  

There is a drawing table here. And a large wardrobe that is oddly organic. Some of the rooms around here have nicer items in them. Smoking pipes, silver hand mirrors, etc. In the wardrobe there are small clothes. No shoes. There is also a set a master malcolm robes. 

  

Siljak turns back from his donkey form back to his human

  

Garland explains that the light here is coming from two hand candles. 

  

The books. One of them has a jeweled flower on the cover. It appears handmade. The other book is a mirror image of the first. 

The first book appears to be a transcription of some letters. The second book appears to Garland to be a spellbook. He can tell this because the sound the pages make are somehow delayed in their sound. They are about Seeming Becoming.  When the second book is moved away from the first, its appearance changes. Apparently it changes its appearance based on what it is near. Garland takes the book.

  

-   Sha Tu is gonna check the game - It is NetherGo. Each of the black squares is a micro portal to..
    
-   Siljak is gonna read the book - Agatha is writing to “S”. She is young. She says she is going to make a sacrifice to end all this.
    
-   Garland is gonna stand watch - 
    
-   Spider Mendel is gonna search around for treasure - he finds a set of Blue Heresy poem cylinders. They speak, but you won’t like what they have to say. 
    

  

Note on the side of one of the barrels. “Best batch yet. Keep ‘em coming 💀“

The group leaves the quarters and heads back into the palace proper.

  

One direction is towards the Torture Theater. The other direction has a residue of some sort of pinkish slime trail. Salsa-like. They follow the slime. One end of the slime trail goes towards the torture pool. Down the other way is carnane. Dead bodies. A huge dead serpentine creature and a metal cart. The flaccid penis monster corpse is on the ground and monster blood is everywhere. There is also dead ratling slave. There is also a dead naked body on the ground. And there’s a metal cart.  

  

The naked body is human. It bears no obvious marks of violence. The body is soft and clearly did not engage in hard labor. Two things stand out. While their body is soft, their neck is freakishly well-defined. Like enhanced. Its neck is just buff. It’s hairless face is locked in a rigor state of terror and agony. 

  

Sha Tu looks further up the hallway to see if he can see anything that might be responsible for this carnage. There are two glyph signs. One points in one direction with a sword and an ax. The other has a symbol of water. 

  

The old slave appears to have succumbed to the acidic excretions from the penis monster. His helmet has been removed. He is wearing a fine satin robe underneath his slave robes. 

  

The group heads towards the crossed weapons. Siljack knows this is headed toward the heart of the palace, the arena of light. At the top of the dome, there are some private quarters that are forbidden, perhaps for the porcelain prince. 

  

As they approach the arena, they come to an arched tunnel that leads to the floor of the arena. Garland notices that there is a silencing effect starting to take hold. There is a glow at the end of the tunnel. 

  

The first thing they see as they enter the arena of light. Raised stadium seats. Hanging in the air above the arena is a complex geometric lattice of hard light. There are these strange filament-like structures coming down from the top of the dome like string or hair or roots looping around the lattice. These strands come off the lattice and into the individuals sitting in the area. Row after row of masked figures. All of them are wearing masks of Agatha’s face and the filament goes into the sigil on the mask. White light blares forth from the mouth and eyes of these masks. 

  

The silence effect turns off as they enter. They hear the cacophony of each person screaming in a most horrendous way. In the center there is another pile of carnage. Ratcatcher limbs. 

  

Mind checks go around

-   Sha Tu 1+1+2
    
-   Siljak 9
    
-   Spider Mendel 7
    
-   Garland 7
    

  

Sha Tu falls to his knees and grasps his head. He has seen something of this image of the tendrils before. It’s artificial and reminds him of his wife who is also artificial. 

  

Garland notices that some of these glass filaments start to snake down toward him. He bats it away just a second after it touches him. It is the sensation of a victim of the penis monster. 

  

Siljak is also touched by a filament and he feels the full weight of his separation from what he used to be here in the Palace of Light. He was punished and they killed his favorite slave. It got planted as part of one of the trees. The tree grew through it. 

  

Mendel starts to mount the stairs. Master Malcom appears on the balcony. He has a gauntlet. He controls the lattice of light and sends a beam at Mendel. He skitters away and the rod of light bursts through the wall opening it to the outside.  

  

Garland vaults over the wall. He swings his femur and severs three tendrils. The tendrils go after him. He takes major damage from images of the hand camel. He shoots the hard light lattice with the two little guns. His head explodes and gore comes out of the eyes and mouth holes of the mask. The lattice explodes and the mode of the tendrils change from screams of horror to sounds of intense pleasure. 

  

Sha Tu propels chunky milk hair at Master Malcom with this launcher. Mendel gets +1.

Siljak hits some of the tendrils with a shank of the lattice of light and hurls it toward Master Malcom. 

  

Master Malcom is revealed to be this rat dude.

“Where am I?” asks Agatha from inside Spider Mendel. “Upstairs” says the rat and then he dies. 

  

In the center of the arena on the floor the team sees two dead rat catchers and the decapitated body of Saito. 

  

Up at the top there is a wooden door. When they open it up there is a pale glow. It is a child’s bedroom. There is a child and a beautiful flower coming out of it.

Next to the child there is a Mendel Automaton in a chair.**
