Goat: Mendel

  

1.  Infiltrate Burn End Prison
    
2.  Release prisoners
    
3.  Detonate prison, hop on Nod, get away
    

  

The Stakes:

Best case scenario: The House of Plenty is out of power, Rohaus rules over Golo with an Iron foot.

Success with consequences: The House of Plenty is dethroned, but famine takes hold and Golo deteriorates and begins to rot

Disaster: By capturing Grosnic, the House of Power gains the remaining control of Nod and they can use him to rule the region

Marshalling the troops. 

Friendly: Tessana, Gulek

Neutral: Bridgers, Dusters, Separatist Leadership (The Ringers), Bozen Black , Pussy Complexus, Sia

Hostile: The Road Agents, The Guards, The House of Plenty

  

Danton is able to convince the Dusters to join the cause. The House of Plenty don’t give a fuck about them or their ways. 

Rohaus attempts to attack some members of The House of Plenty. Tessana sets up a dinner for them and they are all expecting to eat a rare animal. That animal tonight will be played by Rohaus. “Dinner is served Bitches!” He totally whoops their ass. It was such a beatdown, that the Bridgers move up to friendly.

Siljak flips over the meat vendor’s cart and makes an impassioned plea to the leaders of the Ringers to join the cause.

Spider Mendel vs. The Road Agents: After making sure that they know where to find him, Mendel sets an ambush by hiding under the armor waiting for them to approach. When they near, he springs into a murder flurry. 

Grosnic visits PC at “Just like the real thing,” their place of business. He tells them that Golo is the largest experiment of their kind ever. He is very intrigued, but Barol is neutralized as he will not part with her.

Popular Support Dusters Gulek

Force of Arms The Ringers Bridgers

Dirty Tricks Tessana Pussy Complexus

  

Phase One: Infiltration: Tessana knows everything about Burnt End. She knows the layout, the guard schedule, everything. PC sends some of his ladies to distract some of the guards. 

It was a setup. Tessana is made and everything goes to shit. The guards drug her and send her into the fights. She is torn apart by the angry mob. 

  

Phase Two: Full on assault. Lots of words about how fuckin’ epic this fight is. Success. The Bridgers are being overwhelmed by mass attacks. As they start to falter, the Ringers show up with their contraband weapons. 

  

Phase Three: Get out! The Dusters know this area well. They are helping direct the people to where they need to go. Gulek splits off and goes off by himself. Grosnic holds the heart in his hand. “It is time. We need your help. Come!” Nod approaches. Gulek, above, draws energy from the sea and directs it at Burnt End, breaking off the end of the spire. Gulek floats off, and the coffee drinking snake flies up and grabs him. The escapees all climb into Nod. In the captain's chair inside the skull is the remains of the Silence.

  

Danton sets up his ranch / church. He shows the people how some creatures are holy, and some are delicious, including cockatrice. 

  

Rohaus changes the rules on what can be brought into Golo.
