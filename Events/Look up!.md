Previous Adventure: [[Meeting Gulek]]

Tacos… or gasoline shortages.

The weather becomes more overcast with low clouds. 

[[Joy Worms]]: Rohaus eats the worm, and rubs the juice on his ears. Mendel and Danton snort theirs. Siljak eats his worm tapas style. Grosnic just swallows his worm. Everybody's feelin’ pretty good. 

[[Rohaus]] is the GOAT this week. Every step is a struggle out here. Nobody wants to do anything but sleep. Time is distorted. The caravan is lethargic. The animals graze on the gray moss, scraping their teeth on the rocks on which it grows. 

Encounter:

##### Sports Teams 
The wave riders of Kartoon. The players ride winged eels. The Yellow City Cannoneers. 

[[Danton]] sees a hole appear in the cloud cover. “OMG, Look up!” he yells to the others. A beam shoots down from the sky and obliterates [[Faucet]]. Danton gets a taste of pain and takes one harm. [[Mulepede]] has died. Danton realizes now that particles of his artificial hand is flaking off and floating in the air. They see [[Sky Worms]]

[[Gulek]] uses the [[Veda of the Mother Electric]] to attack the swarm of smaller creatures floating in the air. Rohaus runs down, to grab a [[Boom Stick]] to throw it at the swarm. He trips as he runs, falling into the fire. [[Grosnic]] prepares his fire mask to distract the swarm. The gelatinous fire mixture sticks to the swarm and they turn gray and drift away. He catches [[Y.A.M.S.]] on fire.

[[Danton]] runs after the horse and puts him out, catching a kick for his troubles taking 5 damage. [[Siljak]] goes over to [[Rohaus]] to help put him out. It does not go well. [[Mendel]] goes to help Rohaus as well. 

Rohaus sees more glowing and yells, “Another one!” Another swarm appears from the clouds. Grosnic puts Siljak out so he is no longer on fire. 

Danton gets on [[Y.A.M.S.]] and pulls off a sweet lean over grab and picks up the two [[Boom Stick | Boom Sticks]] before riding east.

Secret Eating: Somebody has been taking more than their fair share of supplies. 

The fog is getting thicker. We can’t see far in front of us. We follow [[Gulek]] east. We hear a voice. “Union.”

We see a [[Creatures/Bone Tree | bone white tree]] with many mouths. It says again, “Union.” All the humans are drawn to it.
