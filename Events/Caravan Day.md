April 13, 2021

Each year six caravans are chosen to leave the city in a celebration named Caravan Day. Each is aligned with a different god. We walk down a long tunnel like street which terminates in giant gates, eight stories tall. We await to see which god will watch over our caravan.

The priest turns around and retrieves an idol, which radiates a brilliant white light. He turns back and lifts it above his head. The name is announced, “All the lights that dance.” The crowd goes wild. This god has domains: Knowledge, Madness, and Art. 

“It’s better to bone out, than fade away.” -[[Grosnic]] cries as he fire dances.  They rain down coins on him.

As we pass out of the gates, we see several large golems standing guard. As we travel along the road, we see many merchants in stalls and at their carts, selling supplies. [[Rohaus]] wants to find a disco buddha of All the lights that dance. We buy five of these for 20 cash. 

We reach the crossroads and come upon a stone monument which also acts as signs pointing out destinations. One we do not know, [[Golo]]. As we approach, a small figure climbs on top of it from behind. They wave their arms about, pull down their mask, and shout to us, “You look LOST!!!”. [[Siljak]] replies, “But we just got here :)”

She repeats, “You look lost.” We reply, “Aren’t we all?” 

Her name is Sia. We see her auto-golem. It’s an ultralight vehicle made from some organic material, almost like wicker. She says that she is having some engine trouble and asks if we can assist her. She senses that we don’t trust her. “Don’t worry, I can pay you. Do you like drugs? She goes back to her machine and comes back with a bag full of some type of drug we have never seen before. “I think this stuff is called [[Drugs/QuickSilver]] (Quik).” Grosnic does “[[Vedas/SparkleFingers]]” and the car comes alive. Magic vines spread over the thing and at the end, the head lifts, shakes, and is back awake. We ask if she has been to [[Locations/Wickersham]]. She says, yeah, but I wouldn’t recommend it. 

As we stop to rest the caravan, pit demons howl throughout the night, keeping most of us in a fitful sleep. 

We encounter four people, on the dunes, pouring some liquid out of jugs onto the sand. The sand smokes where they pour and we can smell the fumes. We also see another individual behind us, a single warrior carrying a sword, [[Rasklana]]. We learn that these crater-makers are good simple folk, and welcome us to sit with them. They give us food and drink. We take some extra [[Bubble Bread]] to take with us. [[Siljak]] examines the bread to learn that it is mineral based. 

Rohaus asks Rasklana what the deal is with these guys and what’s up with the sand. “They are legit. They come out here, call down rocks, put it in jars and bring it back to the crater.”

[[Danton]] offers them a disco buddha. They love it.

Grosnic offers them some [[Items/Vampire Wine]] for $120 and offends them by calling their art “squiggles.”

We end up hanging out with [[Rasklana]] and bet on if these guys are gonna get crushed by the meteor they are summononing. We bet $200 that more than 2 of them would get it, but since only 2 did, we hand over two caches of that sweet vampire wine. They tell us we can meet up with them in the Drug Den if we are looking for some action on our [[Wizard Bone]].
