Elf Touched means those that have been touched by elves. It sucks the life force out of them and turns them into zombies. Garland is hunting down Elf-touched (zombies) and taking their remains and selling them. He thinks he can turn one of these hosts into a viable host for Mother. Among the requirements for this host is that it can't be human. 

  

The Undead Wars that ravaged the area were hordes of Elf Touched (or at least they were among them). 

  

Garland has a scar that shows he was part of the Undead Wars. On his forearm he has tattoos made of rare ink & voamish wires. These tattoos/augments are associated with the same shit used in that cloak Danton found that would make him invisible to the Undead.

  

What kind of Zombies are they? When they turn into a zombie it is an incubation period. Eventually they turn into Elves and they can turn folks. The Elves are akin to the White Walkers from Game of Thrones.

See Glossary from Ultraviolet Grasslands--The Elves are called The Ling (also see glossary). Think of the phasing that comes with Wizard Bone.

All new characters were locked up in Burnt End for the following reasons:

Garland: Smuggling necrotic contraband

Shatu: Ate the male cocktrices (spoiler alert, they like the neck sacks and sweet cheeks).

Saito: cooking the books & eating them in protest against the House of Plenty

Recap redux:

  

GOLO thaws out and becomes a living biological thing and lives in harmony with it. 

Rohaus is the new Narco King of GOLO

Grosnic has bonded with NOD

Danton develops a relationship with GOLO and can eventually find a way to transfer his heart into it. He's the caretaker for all the animals including GOLO. As Rancher Pope, that fits his m.o.

  

There is a lot of instability/upheaval in GOLO at the moment and there is a rise in criminal activity while the dust is settling. There is risk if we stick around.

  

Other loose ends:

-   Eater of Names -- The secret Oasis associated with her exists outside of time and place. It is one week away from anywhere on the Yellow Wastes. 
    
-   Nightmare Portrait -- This was stolen and showed up in Bozin Black’s club Mother’s Milk. The titular milk comes from the wall because the cocktrice has made the walls flesh. Each booth has its own teet. He has amazing taste in art and a serious fucking drug problem.Tessana (his daughter) thought returning this portrait would create a good relationship with Nightmare Burger.

-   The hand footed rodent that saw Sijak and ran.
    
-   NOD can take us somewhere.
    

  

Rumors: 

Tears of light are extracted from people or something and it removes the color from them so the water that remains is black (could be the black gold that Shantu is interested in).

The Crew heads to PC’s shop (Just like the Real Thing) to check in on Barryl. The shop is in The Clutches. It’s hollowed out egg cysts that act as private nooks. It’s still like stone, but softer stone. 

-   Shatu rolls die of fate to determine how PC’s business is going. 1. The business is now a food stall. They are eating PC’s brains and eyeballs. Folks are drinking the juice that PC’s brains were in. Behind where folks are eating, we see the remains of PC’s chassis. But Barryl is gone. The hole in PC’s dome is blackened and melted. The tires have popped.
    
-   The Courtesans are running the food stall called Palanquin (pronounced puh-lane-quinn) with the Dentist’s palanquin at its center. Gulek came and emancipated Barryl from PC and in the process uplifted the Courtesans giving them the power communication through a combination of his electrical powers and the sentient words from The Last Story Tree.
    
-   We just give them the thumbs up and hope they all do well.

Prepping for next time:

-   Talk with Bozin about the Nightmare Portrait
    
-   Talk with Eater of Names to get our Oasis pass certified. 
    
-   Re-outfit the caravan.
    
-   Action Item: Find out how much money we really have.
