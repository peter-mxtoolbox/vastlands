Goat: Saito/Peter

  

We step out of the Black Oasis and into the Palace of Light.

We arrive at the back of the PartyBeast. We see several PartyBeast Masters

They drip liquid over the excrement from the PartyBeast to mix up “cocktails”. The PB has many small anuses so the poop is not as huge as you might fear it might be.  The beasts eat the blue bales of hay we see around. The masters notice us as we appear from a “rift” but they pay us no mind and go back to drinking their “Booty Juice”. 

  

The juice is served in a cup that has two bowls that are connected. It is always shared by two people. Spider Mendel drinks a cup using his two fangs. Usually people are wired up and so time seems slow for them. It does the opposite for our spider friend and he experiences the world at 10 times speed. He bumps into everything including the beast. The partygoers all laugh at him. 

  

Saito grabs 6 tight cubes of party beast poop.

  

The light from the palace is blinding. All the party people have eye protection. The light behaves somewhat oddly. It feels tangible. There is a nomad up top the beast. He looks at us. We motion to him. He lowers a bucket to us and demands a tribute.

Circo Langolo

  

Garland Churchwater starts juggling a poop cube while on the back of Spider Mendel to make them appear appealing. Saito jumps on his cube and starts dancing. One of the people laughing at our spectacle falls off. Siljak goes to catch him, breaking his fall and taking damage. 

  

We each ride the bucket to the party. The nomad introduces himself as Circo Langolo, a banker. “High” Wants to dance with the flower people and feel love all of the time. 

  

“What brings you to the Palace of Light. And what is up with your clothes?” 

  

“Everybody was wearing these in the Yellow City when we left,” says Siljak

  

Spider Mendel learns from a few fashionable women from the Yellow City that the hair shirt is a style from a very very very long time ago. They see that he is eavesdropping and give him the stink eye. 

  
“What brings you out this way? Where are my manners? You lost.” 

  

“Aren’t we all”

  

“I heard there were some neat trees around here,” says Siljak. He then notices these radiant cherry blossom trees inside the palace walls. The trees are growing through corpses. Some fountain’s trees are not growing well or perhaps they are dying. 

  

Siljak remembers these trees. They are from where he is from. In fact… he brought them here. When he sees the people, he looks down on them as being the easy way to grow these trees.

  

Garland asks a Sarlanj debutante about the games. The only way to see the games is to become a witness or to become a peice. He asks about who is in charge of the PartyBeast. 

  

Reclaimed Alchemical Lubricants are various wet things that keep machines running. They are the snacks du jour on the Party Beast. 

  

Spider Mendel trades the Geo Skull for his necklace of Azurite. He got them from the valley of the cats. There was an epic battle of the Zombie War there. 

  

Once you go into the Gate of Goodbyes to become a witness you never come out. They used to trade slaves here, but now they grow their own. 

  

We head over to the Torture Garden to rest up. 

  

Did we sample and delicacies of the Vastlands? Yes, Syringes and Cubes

Did we see / experience weird shit? Yes

Did we reach a new destination? Yes

  

Sha Tu, Saito, Mendel, and Garland need to level next session.
