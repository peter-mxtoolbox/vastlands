🐐: Mongag

[[Idsovak]] not in attendance.

`Mongag leveled up. We have split the $20k between the gang of four.`  

The possum knight shows up to the docks at the Rocks of Exile. They both go into the bar.

2nd Brother is still unconscious Possum Knight

  

[[Mongag]] does some shopping. The [[PSYCHOPOMP'S SEAL]] and 5 [[Slime Whistles]] (500). He asks about any special hair product he might have in the back. There is a colony of degenerate [[Violet City]] cats that live in and around the [[_Valley of the Cats]] leading to a brisk market for Cat Bags [38:00 mark]. Cat bag with congealed cat piss. Horrible to drink, but great on the hair. He buys one for $1100. 

  

The [[Possum Knight]] is pleading with the patrons of the [[Weak Barol]] to tell them about the oncoming disaster. The rest of the bar is too busy with their bar songs they are singing together. 

  

[[Nopal]] talks with Possum Knight and asks about the danger. We find out about the [[KaiGool]]. He shows us his map.

The Hatriarch invites us to the Hutch to watch. Sha Tu goes there. There might be wagering involved. Nopal is coming with Mongag up to the bridge. KennyG takes a water taxi with Idsovak. 

  

We ride up in a cage to the bridge. The smell of cinnamon rolls is in the air. Much grooming is going on. Mongag tells of his own virtue. His shiny plastic skin, his organ that makes his food, and his arts and crafts. Nopal gives a speech and says that Mongag is his own best man. 

  

Sha Tu places $5k against the $10k of [[Hatriarch]] and [[Catriarch]].

Mirkbuilder comes forth and says, “Homewrecker! I’ll have you know I’m a happily married man.”

  

Mongag offers him the cat bag as a gift. He knocks it out of his hand and off the bridge.

  
  

Mongag uses Sidu of the Soiled Wind to fart on him. There is a massive booming sound from the horizon. It is the [[Kai Gool]].

Some of the people are starting to freak out. 

  

Sha Tu tries to sell the Hat/Catriarch on an escape plan deal since has lost all his money. He also decides to shoot the bridge that the Duke is on to try to thwart him. He hits the bridge. It cuts through both ropes. The Duke lands in the water. Kenny serves him directly from the water. 

  

Nopal makes it to the God-to-Be. It asks Nopal, “Have we met?”

“No, but I feel like I know you.”

“How”

“I spoke with your Hagiographer”. 

“What do you think?”

“I think it will inspire many. I think you deserve some peace. Is his account accurate?”  
“Some parts are truer than others.”

“Do you like The Waveriders?”

“Not so much. Orange City until I die.” He looks at the Ghool. “So that’s a situation.”  
“What do you think?”

“Speaking as a celestial being, I’d say it’s time to get the hell outta here.”

“Do you wanna be?”

“If I could get off this damned pedestal”

  

They make a deal to shrink him down and carry him to the Holy Mountain, get him a new Hagiographer, and worship me. 

  

We are able to save the [[Catriarch]] and [[Possum Knight]] along with [[Characters/God-to-Be]]. Unfortunately [[Slaam]] was not able to make it.
