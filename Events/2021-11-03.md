More about Glasshorns: They cannot stack additional goods on them and just take a slow tag. They can only hold what they can hold (4)

  

We buy four glasshorns: Tusk-tusk, Sunnuva, La Bomba and Puddin foot. The mules join Danton on his ranch.

  

We store our Cockatrice eggs in a carton and pack them in a glasshorn. 

  

We are thinking of kicking off a culinary empire. 

  

Saito is looking for any information he can find about the painting of a cyan sea. Next time we need to talk with Bozin Black about his painting.**
