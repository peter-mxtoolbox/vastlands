Goat: Siljak / Brad

  

Level Ups

Sha Tu - Is tough +1 natural armor after coming into his third puberty

Garland - Is Tenacious: Gain +1 MAX STRAIN

Saito - Became Mutated with Perfectly Balanced

Shortimers: All stats are +1

I level up every 5 XP

At level 5 I die

This is caused by the cube I ride. It is giving me radiation that empowers me, but also is killing me.

  

We talk to Mendel and send him to sneak into the Palace of Light

  

The dick pillars are to be delivered to Depico de Caravan. 

  

The lightning trees that are outside the palace walls are dead. They require the fountain irrigation systems to thrive. 

  

The Sin Eater is not of any colored land. They are an outsider. Their service is to absolve guilt, sin, mental scar, etc. Whenever people speak of the sin eater, they also speak of shadows.  Garland gets excited because he is a Shadow Merchant. We head in that direction.

As we pass Trading Places, we see slaves for sale. We also notice there is an animal following us. It’s about two feet long warty fish swimming through the air about a foot off the ground. When we stop to look at it, it pauses and stares intently at a stall full of hats. The slave in the hat stall modeling them, kicks annoyedly at the fish. His foot passes through it. The fish heads off towards the yurt of the sin eater. 

  

At the door we notice all sorts of contraptions to clean off your feet, tentacles, or whatever the hell you use to drag your ass around. “Don’t bring your dirt in my yurt”. There is furniture strewn about and one seat is emitting soft light.

Sin Eater

  

Kar-toosh is his name, eatin’ sin is his game. Garland knows him. He used to be a trapper as well, but shit went bad. He got touched by an elf. There are dark rumors about how one can cure themselves from the elf touch, but it’s a devil’s bargain. He has to consume sin force to counteract it. 

  

Elf-touched eventually turn into a zombie, then you turn elf touched and infect others.  

Kar-toosh trusts Garland. They drop back into banter like back in the day. He introduces Sha tu who explains his problem where he gets nauseous whenever he eats… you know from his memories of eating the babies. 

  

Kar-toosh explains to the group how this works. The device he has is very rare. It is so old that he has had to make lots of modifications to keep it working. The lens was salvaged from a giant mechanized golem. Sha tu sits in the glowing chair in front of a blank wall. THe “Sinerator” will strobe and project the sin onto the wall as a shadow. 

  

Siljak wants to feed the sin back to the tongue of the eater of names. So he stands behind Sha tu and in front of the wall. As the machine starts up, it sucks all of the light out of the room. Sha tu is brought back in his mind to the memory. He sees that the baby has tentacles on its head. The tongue begins to swell in Siljaks throat. It is awake and wants more flavors. Saito hits him with a super fast heimlich punch to help and it leaps out of Siljak’s throat and squirms away. 

  

Chapter 2: Tongue hunt

Garland looks in Nomads Land : He sees a bunch of sour faced slavers. Angry and sad.

Saito went to Trading Places : He interrupted some complex trade negotiation between some weird guy and a pair of these beak dudes:![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/BDvhTmHgM6Z7_pFIezhFCYX0BDyf5exQzEB8jkp4w4X2I6Hgyc1N8GLNcWDAgSl2JjYci3GxW8ztHxx4XXHlyemmPRp2cKWrZejvbOOli1jcK7i_qpAvXqvW_Vw5DcQsUZbCO3D8riWJgMtmRA) ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/taI4IbzZsHxPXn5kdriydK8aBMy2YMDK6QtZzDtW8equEL9gkrHTxjBW-2O_N2YI_NtNuW3yLjQG8K97OOyJ73Jrf0PbEQfyyOEKb5V_fdzDQMUTKVznYQ4D9jCP1_aNymjvczW8OG8BjcAM7A)![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/mBQBNTSCOcbpWMJui4LCp5fQhKENNydaUmZ4pagatn77DMN_jh75UYWXhDN3O7HvFM-w-qgUl_SJxMlfFxeEW-epN_SQLI1L0syveQI8jo6Q0v0d83B69I38Gt6V_8gdcvT4_UYGEhbVGNEtZA)

He was trying to buy a pair of slaves in a cage, some ratlings. 

Sha-tu went to Torture Garden : “Here tonguey tonguey tonguey!!!” : “We don’t have any to spare!” The bat thing says “TRUTH!” ![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/T547EbDffK9w2o14Mqk9TrIL6D1kzSwvZGZHA4qjFHvNNLT62nLAU8NetYajxAhcyyrJNrQ6IbqI60FZel1qxmgnE674T5XtveHHdg0X4MPZjXM4tlrnnZEsaMOag8W5jqg-XlY5SR7Hv3sibA)

Siljak went to Palace Improper : Winner winner chicken dinner

  

He yells “Everybody! Don’t be alarmed. There’s a tongue on the loose. Please don’t step on it.” He sees this thing with many arms holding the tongue.

Arm Camel

  

Siljak recognizes the clothing the halfling on the arm camel is wearing as the same that he saw himself wearing back in Bozen Black’s office when he looked at the nightmare portrait. Siljak using the SIDU OF THE RHETORS thanks the halfling and orders it to return the tongue. It is a polite phrase but also one of firmness. The rider pulls the reins to not return the tongue, but the arm camel resists of its own accord and returns the tongue back. The patrons all take notice when he uses the language. 

  

Siljak puts the tongue into a bowl of wine to clean it off as it is covered in dirt from squirming all around. We all meet up at Torture Garden. The gardener asks, “Are all of you here… of your own free will?” He blows into the mouthpiece. Bubbles flow out of the top to the bat through the tube. The bat says, “TRUTH!”

Carnamente, the torture gardener.

Nanci the gardener apprentice

  

When she notices Sha-tu staring she says, “That’s my earth name, meat!” Garland goes up to touch her and she swipes at him with her blade. She just catches the brim of his hat. Saito draws his blade and stares her down. Carnamente says, “Ladies and Gentlemen, we are all human here.” 

  

Sha-tu mentions that he is not human, but a Carnamante says that he is the most human of all of us. Saito knows of the Rainbow inquisition: a body that was established in the lands around the circle C. We are all part of humanity. 

  

Garland whispers to the bat, “I’m a chicken” The bat begins to quiver. He can sort of see the bat’s face and he backs away. The bat remains silent. 

  

Carnemante offers greetings to us and asks if we need anything. Siljak asks for some glasses for our wine. Nanci claps and human slaves come up carring cups and a bottle, one has nothing and gets on it’s hands and knees and becomes a table. 

“Chairs?” Carnemante inquires? 

“Of course” says Siljak. Four more slaves come out.

Sha-tu wants to know if there are any rules we should know about.

Carnemante explains the house rules. He says nobody in the house is here against their will. They are all here by choice. 

Sha-tu asks his chair if they are here by choice.

The chair nods their head and says in a quiet voice, “Yes”

The bat says, “TRUTH!”

  

It’s 100 ducats per week to stay here.

  

Carousing:

Sha-tu: ($200) (4)

Siljak: ($500) (4)

Delighted by your antics when being shot at, Margrave Purpureo, invites you atop the party beast to enjoy exotic substances. Spiced ejaculate from the barrel of a rifle.

Margrave Purpureo

  

They see the palace lights go from colored to white that signals that another witness has been killed which means that there is another opening. People start shooting into the air. Purpureo charges up his rifle and shoots it as well.

Siljak gets a gift, a four armed taxidermied zebra-striped Ape on a lava rock base that says, “Now do you believe me?” Worth 3,000. In the hollow base are $2000 worth of exotic metamorphic drugs. 

Sha-tu gets stabbed in the chest by the party beast driver with his poison dagger. He gets a permanent disability (-1 Mind). He totally deserved that shit. He got it because he kept trying to eat the gems on the party beast drivers robes. Sha-tu keeps the knife of Aniff.

Party Beast Driver Aniff

  
  

Garland: ($100) (3)

Saito: ($500) (3)

Chance encounter at an orgy ends up with a romantic entanglement and get a fringe benefit. 

Garland bumps into the halfling (Master Minimus) and his arm camel. The camel gives a great full body massage. We also get a discount at the Palace Improper for gossip.

Saito bumps into Nanci. She’s crazy about me. She’s also just crazy. She confides in me that she cannot stand Carnemante and that she could run the place way better. Her father is a butcher banker back in Emerald city. She also tells him that she’s gifted in a special way. She can smell a soul when it leaves a body. 

  
  

Everybody gains an XP

  
  
  
  

End of Session: Mendel is still ready to level up from the last session. Saito is going to level as well. Sha-tu as well. 

  

Did we sample and delicacies of the Vastlands?  Yes

Did we see / experience weird shit? Yeah. 

Did we reach a new destination? No.
