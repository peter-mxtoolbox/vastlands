Previous Adventure: [[Dentist Appointment]]

May 4, 2021

We eat and head back to the city. We roll no misfortune. 

We rest up one day to lick our wounds. [[Grosnic]] is so harmed that he applies some of his <span style="font-family: 'Brush Script MT'; color: rgb(239,186,44);">Yellow City Heart Rub</span>. You rub this salve into your armpits and sit for 30 minutes. 

We come across [[Yellow City Road Agents]] a mix of cop and bounty hunters. The four of them ride horses and are in custody of a pale gray man in robes. His bald head is tattooed. The blue one asks, “Who speaks for this caravan?” 

[[Danton]] replies, “Greetings officer. What can we do for you this fine day?” He offers them [[Bubble Bread]]. The lead agent offers to let us go if we give him more bubble bread. Danton says he has to talk to the rest of the caravan.

TODO: COMBAT BOARD IMAGE

[[Rohaus]] goes up to talk to the prisoner. The prisoner pulls the rope binding him taught, and then sends purple lightning down the rope and the yellow knight is sent to the ground and is motionless. 

Rohaus shoots the blue knight with his crossbolt. Grosnic also targets the blue knight but takes one damage in return. [[Siljak]] attacks blue. 

**Details are missing from some of the action**

The green knight charges Grosnic, but he deflects the lance into the ground. Miraculously the knight is impaled on his own lance and is killed.

[[Rasklana]] is trampled as the red knight rides off. 
  
Danton tells the captive to kill the red knight if he wants to live. A snakelike bolt emerges from the gray man toward the knight. Danton throws his boltcaster to Rohaus to shoot the knight's horse. We take all their shit and leave them with [[ Gulek | Gulek the Wizard]].  We get two horses and they are packed with armor, weapons, and supplies.

“We killed a bunch of cops and got a wizard.”

We hang out with Gulek and he tells us of the dangers of travels to the [[Locations/Story Tree]]

[[Drugs/Joy Worms]] are symbiotic worms that give the users joy and cause them to become hazy. 

[[Rohaus]] gives some of the teeth to the dudes and we tell them to spread the word and the teeth.

[[Mendel]] studies the book and learns that it is mostly about bones.

We part ways with [[Rasklana]] but we might see her at the Harpy Brothel if we make it there.
