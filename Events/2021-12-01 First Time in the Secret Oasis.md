Goat: Garland/Philip

  

Siljak is the “keymaster” of the Secret Oasis and rolls to control it. We are swaddled in darkness and we feel like we are falling into unconsciousness. When we awaken, we are on the shores of dark still water. There is nothing in the sky and we are surrounded by seas of silver sand. We are covered in black crabs that scuttle away as we awaken.

The crabs start to tear up Saito’s armor and steal Sha Tu’s cane sword. Sonic death slurp sound is made when Mendel spears the crab going after Saito’s armor. The sound could kill a flesh being, but it resonates Mendel’s body in such a way that he gets pleasure from it. 

  

The sound disturbs the glasshorns. Bubbles form inside them. Garland massages the back of their heads to numb them out. It mostly works, but one of the creatures stirs. It pulls the cart which crushes another crab. The death slurp totally freaks it out and it runs off pulling the cart behind it.

  

Siljak notices as he is looking around, that we can see pretty far, but that the shadows here are odd. They are almost laggy and slow to react when the things making them move. 

  

Sha Tu and Saito go after the cane being stolen by the crabs.

Siljak and Garland chase after the glasshorn.

Spider Mendel grabs the teeth from the ran over crab and hangs out at “camp”

  

Garland picks up a femur from the ground (which is actually made of many bones) and jams it into the wheel of the cart. A bone splinter breaks off and lodges in his leg, which begins bleeding profusely. He keeps the shard as a dagger.

  

Sha Tu attempts to wrestle the sword cane from the crabs, but he only gets a hold of the scabbard. The crabs pinch him.  Saito uses his devastator attack to kill the crabs and uses his Aural Corona to protect them from the Sonic Death Slurps. 

  

Mendel, having chilled out at the camp for a while, feels a vibration from one direction. He enjoys eating some of the chimmy’s as the crabs are now called. There seems to be some sort of crystalline salts in the crab. 

  

Sha Tu smells a fragrance. We head in that direction. Garland stays behind to pick up a bag of bones. He notices that the lights reflected in the water are starting to move. He begs us to continue in our path away from the water. Others make out a smell as well, but it smells different to different people.

  

Garland follows some tracks up a dune. We see this creature that is very large in the distance.

Sha Tu waves at the creature. We hear a series of clicks and buzzes. It kneels down and starts to dig through its bag. It has a large pole with trinkets attached to it. When it sticks the pole into the ground, the opposite end erupts in a non-threatening flame. He pulls out a sign and sets it up. 

  

Garland walks up and asks, “Hey, what’s that smell?” It emits a pink smoke from it’s rear vents. It smells like cinnamon rolls to Garland. The creature lays a small rug between them. On the rug appears a “thinking cap” which is a bundle of pink nerve fibers. Placed on the head of an animal, it will gain sentience. Never ever put it on a human. 

  

While trying to figure out what to do, the creature waves it’s arm over the cap, and it disappears. He waves his other hand and a new item appears. 

  

Folded up, bizarre garment, a vacuum sealed membrane containing elegant commando armor. 

  

Sha Tu attempts to trade chunky milk hair for the armor. Saito takes off his armor and adds it to the milk hair to try to sweeten the deal. It looks to each of us.

  

Sha Tu looks at the creature with his Looking Glass with an articulating eye. Under the mechanisms, he sees a writhing mass of worms. Sha Tu attempts to offer a single hair ball.

  

The creature makes a “no” sound again and then puffs out nasty smell and walks off. 

  

Siljak attempts to communicate with the tongue of the eater of names. It’s nasty, but in the end we find the way to the Palace of Light

  

Did we sample and delicacies of the Vastlands? Mendel did

Did we see / experience weird shit? Yes

Did we reach a new destination? Yes

  

Sha Tu and Spider Mendel need to level at the next session.
