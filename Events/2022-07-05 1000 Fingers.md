üêê: Pete/Mongag?

  

Nopal needs to roll up a new ability/key word from the chart (this is his level up perk) and roll up a new purpose on the road/starting item (or whatever needs to be done to reset his individual storyline).¬†

It is a Kaiju Ghoul. A KaiGool. It destroys the caravan in the west by taking flight and then belly flopping on top of them. Possum Knight survived by‚Ä¶playing possum.

The first thing we see are these shallow draft boats festooned with flowers. They have whistles that are very famous. They sound like a mixture between a kazoo and a slide whistle.¬†

  

We see two characters fighting on Grooms‚Äô Bridge. One falls off and is retrieved after hitting the water by one of the boats. A giant cheer erupts from half of the onlookers.¬†

Fingerton ¬† ¬† Slaam

  

The giant rotting head emits a delicious cinnamon roll aroma. The citizens are called Fingertons.¬†

  

The party beast saddles up next to the Rock of Exiles. We see the dockmaster who looks like a Waverider of Kattoon. Nopal rushes over to talk with him. He tells him he is a big fan. Slaam shows Nopal a picture of Ken and asks if he knows or has seen him.¬†

  

The Weak Barol Tavern is here. The waiter is the grandchild of Gulek and Barol.

Weak Barol Waiter ¬† ¬† hagiographer

  

The writer plies his trade on the back of skinterns called skinbacks where they will set their work and remove the skin when it is complete.¬†

  

Mongag wants to talk to the writer to see if he might have any leads on who might have attacked him in his youth. He asks Scab to go with him to break the ice.

  

Sha Tu takes out his Nether Go set and begins to set it up. He deftly places a drink on the Skin-tern‚Äôs body (balancing perfectly). The Hagiographer is not interested in Nether Go, but he loves him some alcohol, so he continues to listen. Mongag lays out his history and asks if he knows anything regarding a culture or people that may have perpetrated the atrocities against him.

  

Galol is here writing the hagiography for The God to Be. This will be his greatest work. After Mongag asks him for information he starts digging through his sheafs of skin

Surviving in a poisoned oasis, lurking underneath the water. Could communicate with minds, but only while they slept. They would hear his voice, come and drink the water, and then die.

  

Nomad with a crown on their head. When the crown was removed the head hatched, and they died. The crown was crucial for God to Be to escape. Papa spark enters the bar.¬†

  

God-to-Be aka Thousand Fingers is a big fan of marriage and has a goal to marry as many people as he can. You need to get a Connubial Gospel to approach the bridges. You have to fight the current consort to get the opportunity to marry him next.
