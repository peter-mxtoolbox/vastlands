We have ventured into a new part of the map:  [[The Mountains of Light]]

![[MountainsOfLight.png|Mountains of Light]] 

Areas: [[Doom Farms]], [[Valley of the Cats]], [[Thesus]], [[Mad Anvil]], [[Lazy Pilgrim]], [[The Holy Mountain]].

[[Thesus]] is insect town.

[[Valley of the Cats]] is like a last stand battlefield memorial type place.
  
[[The Party Beast]] has a growth that they harvest to eat as sustenance. They call it [[meat fruit]]. If they are not harvested, they attract other scavengers. If people don‚Äôt remove them, it will rub up against things like buildings to remove them. If they are not harvested in time, they rot.¬†

#### Road Hardship
Carnivorous chasm attack: [[Mongag]] is pulling [[2nd Brother]] on a litter along side the caravan, as he is unconcious. A hellish earth mouth opens and devours [[2nd Brother]]. While [[Mongag]] tried to pull 2nd Brother out,  all he was able to save was a pouch containing his golden needle and thread he used to update his story blanket. Before leaving the chasm vomits up something valuable from underground. It is a great spiral [[Fossilized Lightning Horn]] on a chain. It is filled with the currency of the men of [[The Holy Mountain]] -- platinum droplets that are liquid when in the horn, but congeal into small beads when poured out.  

#### Road Encounter
As we are threading our way through the jutting land formations, we come across a ruin. It's like a tangle of bones. Upon closer inspection we see it is part of a larger structure with an interior and perhaps it opens up below the surface.

#Tanglebone_Ruins

What we see on the sign is almost like an evolved version of a current language. We see flashes of color on the stone on the inside. It looks like graffiti or artwork. But as we observe it, it moves in a manner similar to a timelapse or something. [[Ms. Psu]] comes along with us as we go inside to explore it.¬†

  

‚ÄúI have an interesting problem I am trying to solve. I was wondering if you could help me with it. I wish to be decapitated,‚Äù says Psu.
 
  

In the middle of the room is a gaunt figure sitting cross legged. They have a very strange brass contraption attached at the shoulder with tubes going into their head. There is a tether that is attached to the contraption that appears to be attached to a cloud of vapor above their head.¬†

  

This person is an artist. We see in a corner that there seems to be a flight of stairs going down. We see an even layer of fine dust all around that has not been disturbed. They must have been here and still for a very long time. There is a nice gun on the ground near them. It appears baroque.¬†

Tanglebone Figure

  

Mongag takes a close look at the figure and just grunts his disapproval. The art on the shirt appears to react.¬†

  

Idsovak takes the gun that fuses material together. [39:00] Malignant fusion ray. It fuses meat and anti-meat.

  

Finds a caravan in the basement that has been merged together horrifically by the fusion device.¬†

  

From the caravan meat pile, Idsovak fished the Ur-glass brain of a Long Ago thief that stole the secret of immortality from a monarch. The Ur-glass is unaffected by the fusion, it is neither meat, nor anti-meat

  

We decide to wake the figure up. His eyes instantly snap to. The graffiti on the walls detaches from the wall. [[Idsovak]] announces herself as Elevated descendant of the needle. [[Nopal]], [[Mongag]], and [[Sha Tu]] unload on him. Color is splattered everywhere and the vapor cloud bursts into flame.¬†

  

RIP: Second Brother

There is a ceremony where people stitch memorials into their cloaks for 2nd Brother. [[Mongag]]¬† is the holder of 2nd Brother‚Äôs cloak and he adds to it. [[Grandma]] acknowledges and assists him.¬†

  

Boots?¬†
