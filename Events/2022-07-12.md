[[Duke Mirkbuilder]] is known around here as [[Duke Mirkbuilder|Angelhair]]. Connubial Gospels can be gotten legit at the Hatriarch‚Äôs Hutch or a less official one at the Little Shoppe of Exiles.¬†

  

Slaam has been paid quite a bit of money by the Duke to watch out for and kill Ken on sight and burn any documents on his person. He and Nopal and Rattlefuss are drunk and drinking.![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/etXCUkqOZ3GhDgaFeGhLfMPtOP3CJWIpeawVbe8hA7uSwZaplaYvjGmh0YyJk3A2WxqxpRWJv5Nci2KeowNjZ2Wv4q4I1C9T7ggV1Yb2IDfm33edqzV0BfcmR-PeNSZoNk3Hdizhc-rLk-hRcDpiYts)

  

We head over to the shoppe run by Jakki Once. It is filled with wonderful objects but we are short on liquid cash.

  

Flash of information: The KaiGool is still out west flying around and causing rain.¬†

  

Sha Tu sells him the Emerald City Medallion for $2000.¬†

We barter with a ![[New Assets/Rude Tooth.png|Rude Tooth]] Clan for a blood diamond for a ride to the Hatriarch‚Äôs Hutch.

Sha Tu chats with the fellow to try to get some info about the Hatriarch.¬†

  

For a pair of diamonds he tells us some stuff. One is that the Hatriarch gives out Connubial Gospels for free, so make sure you don‚Äôt fall for the Shoppe selling them.¬† He also tells us about the tooth cult and how it came about. The Night Mouth clan paints their teeth black. The ![[New Assets/Rude Tooth.png|Rude Tooth]] clan take it a step further and pull out all their teeth.¬†

  

Mongag uses the Veda of the [[Flying Serpent]] to get a lift up to the Hutch. He puts his hands to his mouth and makes some undulating sounds and hand gestures. It pisses off the water taxi driver because it‚Äôs angering the creatures in the water. [1:18 mark].¬†

  

The serpent is humongous. It spirals around the tower and we can easily climb up to the top. As we get up there we see the Hatriarch and the Catriarch drinking coffee and swinging in hammocks.¬†

They are not too pleased with our entrance as the serpent has somewhat made a mess of the tower causing it to rock back and forth and mess up their hammocking.¬†

  

Hatriarch says the Gospel should be ready in a few weeks.

  

Sha Tu mentions out loud, ‚ÄúI wonder if the God-to-Be might ever be going on a honeymoon?‚Äù

Hatriarch says he might if he ever gets his fat ass off that pillar.

Catriarch says, ‚ÄúPerhaps a group of sufficiently motivated individuals could help him off that pillar.‚Äù

  

Kenny asks about the origins of the God-to-Be. Where did it come from? How did it get there?¬†

‚ÄúThe God-to-Be was placed there one night. We awoke the next day and it was there.‚Äù

  

While talking over our plans within our group the Catriarch hears of our plans to kill the God. We tell him of our need for cash and of our trove of Blood Diamonds. We explain how they can quench the thirst of a vampire and how they are worth $1000 each. He asks us to say that again. Sha Tu does and the Gnosis bat says, ‚ÄúTruth!‚Äù We sold him 20 (which is what we said we had) for $20,000.¬†

  
The Catriarch also advises us that instead of a ring that we might get a seal for the God-to-Be‚Äôs dowry we might get the PSYCHOPOMP'S SEAL from the Shoppe. Sha Tu asks also if Catriarch knows of any weakness that [[Duke Mirkbuilder|AngelHair]] might have that he might know of. He says that he is vain and any insult might unsettle him somewhat.

  

### Rattlefus

He confides in Nopal that he doesn‚Äôt want to be an assassin. He likes being a burglar, but ever since I got this haunted knife, I feel pressured to do this line of work. I try to keep it sheathed and away from everyone, but I fell to its temptation and now I‚Äôm out killing people. My first mission at the palace of light was a disaster. My skull is a curse from the Nightmareburger Queen. He asks Nopal about Mongags talking weapon. You can‚Äôt buy or sell ghost forged weapons, but you can trade them. Do you think he might be interested in something that is more about killing? The knife does have a really cool thing it can do. It was designed that after you stab somebody with him that it magically cleans itself afterwards and drinks their blood so you don‚Äôt make a mess. You can also stab something that was painted or written and it will absorb the paint or the writing. And you can reverse the process. And a warning. If he gets the knife, you have to watch out for Sue. She really wants to cut her head off so she could put it on something else.¬†

  

The party makes it way back down to the rock of exiles.

  

Did we bond with our new family?

Did we move closer to advancing our own personal quest?

Did we reach a new destination or place?

  

Mongag will level on the next session.
