Beastmaster Dude

  

Where can we take the tongue so Sha Tu can use it to access the Black Oasis?

Raskalana is going to take the cube back to the monastery.

Truth Bat

  

Nopal and Mongag come across the Truth Bat. They were about to pass it by when Ostrander (the Tempting Intelligent Gun Wand) talks Mongag into taking it on as a pet. It‚Äôll help you.

  

Nopal discovers a ‚Äúbox‚Äù. It turns out it is a meat box / organ. It can open when you tickle it.

  

An exquisit set of dancing rainbow inquisitor needles that torture but never kill.

  

Sha Tu stands face to face with the Party Beast. A great exhalation blows over him and it smells ancient. He tells the tongue that it should go into the beast.¬† They ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù the party beast with a ‚Äútuning fork‚Äù in specific patterns. It yawns. Sha Tu yawns. The tongue shoots out over to the beast.

  

The beast starts to move. We head north-east out of town towards a tunnel. The tunnel is huge and ringed with teeth?

  

#58263 wants to know if this route is normal or common. Ms Grati responds

Ms ‚ÄúPsu‚Äù Grati

Her voice is sort of like it is airy and going through bellows. A little ‚Äúbuzzy‚Äù.

He mentions this is the Sand Sovereign and ‚Ä¶ Perhaps the Golan Sea was larger at some point in the past.¬†

  

Makromir mentions that the bridgers¬† were wiped out by hordes of flying serpents that used to roam all over this land. The flock would act as a single unit when moving.

Raddlefuss

  

Raddlefuss has to go into a privy because we need it to be completely silent in order to transition into the Black Oasis.¬†

  

We wake up in the Oasis. The sky is pitch black. There are no stars. The sand all around us illuminates the area somewhat. The water is still and black. The party beast is standing and walking ON the water. As it steps, ripples radiate around from it.¬†

  

Nopal attempts to communicate with the party beast. The beast senses that there is something beneath the surface of the water and it is nervous. The beast masters start clanging their forks and it starts to gallop.

  

We pick up speed and the ride is rough. The lights from under the water continue to keep up with our forward movement. The shore does not appear to be getting nearer.¬†

Black Oasis Fish

  

The fish signal to us with the hands at the end of their tails. It turns out the reason that the party bus is on top of the water and not in the water is because the fish are holding us up. They demand a tribute for this service. They point at a female beast master. She is wearing a robe and a pointed hood. She is wearing a basket type backpack. The backpack moves. An odd baby creature pokes its head out. The fish go into a frenzy

Beastmaster Mother and Baby

  

Blue God Incident:¬†

Blue Heresy poem cylinders - Sha Tu goes to the massive horn that is hanging from the rigging used to speak down to people around the beast and reads the poems. When the words hit the water, the sea of the Black Oasis boils. Sha Tu‚Äôs top two tentacles fall off. The mother acknowledges his sacrifice. She places her hand on him. When doing so he notices her other hand which looks like it has been burned and is all gnarled and scarred.

  

We make it to shore. It is covered with the carapaces of many black crabs.¬†

Black Crabs of the Black Oasis

  

Sha Tu tells us that the last time he was here, all the crabs were migrating in a single direction. We decide to follow the crabs.¬†

  

We come across a large head shaped thing half buried in the sand. It is surrounded by thousands of crabs all facing it in circles. This item looks like it has been here for a VERY long time. We approach it. Sha Tu recognizes the cheese helmet next to Nod. #58363 takes the helmet.¬†

  

Sha Tu mentions to us that time here must act very differently. Psu agrees with him.

  

Signs of long term habitation here ‚Äì Grosnic and his pirate crew made up from the reanimated statues from Golo. Sha Tu recognizes an iconic headdress from a statue he saw at Golo. There are many bodies here so they must have perished in a short amount of time. The nomads of our party are touched by the scene. They want to honor the fallen by camping here and having a fire ritual.

  

The party beast riders all gather together and light a fire. They have special kindling for the ‚ÄúWaking of the Fire‚Äù. They take care to find something from the area to be part of the ritual. Visrulate, ‚Äúthose who become sparks‚Äù. After it is all prepared, the mother comes over and opens her papoos. The baby pops its head up and claps its hands. When it does, the fire sparks to life.¬†
