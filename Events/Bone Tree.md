[[Mendel]] uses his magic to try to figure out what is going on here. [[Rohaus]] is drawn very near the tree. Mendel gets a strong sense of human remains inside the tree. The limbs reach out and grab Rohaus which breaks him out of his trance. It rips the straps on [[Danton| Danton's]] armor causing it to fall away. [[Grosnic]] attempts to fear the tree with fire. [[Gulek]] does not resist at all. Two of the tree guards capture him. 

Rohaus attempts to fire on one of the guards but his cross bolt thrower string has broken. Grosnic attacks the guard near the [[Palanquin]]. Mendel animates the bones that the lead guard is wearing. Gulek gets a rifle butt. Danton calls [[Y.A.M.S.]] over and rides into the group, falling into a pile. He pulls the guard over and Y.A.M.S. hooves him to death. [[SIljak]] starts shouting trying to drown out the tree’s calling but it does not go as planned. 

The [[Creatures/Bone Tree]] attacks Danton and Rohaus. Rohaus loses his cross bolt completely. Danton and Y.A.M.S. are scratched to shit.  Rohaus attempts to save Gulek, but gets pinned down. Grosnic attacks the tree with his hammer axe which is buried into the tree. 

[[Zombies]]: [[Mendel]] attempted to reanimate the dead in the tree to attack it. He didn’t realize that it was filled with hoards of dead which come spilling out as Zombies. They attack everything. 

Siljak gets attacked and goes to 1 health and is knocked unconscious. 

Danton rides Y.A.M.S. to go save Siljak. The zombie hurts Danton badly, he has 1 health left. 

Rohaus fights the Zombie which is on top of the knocked out Gulek, killing it. Again.

Grosnic mounts [[BBQ]] and rides down to save Danton. Mendel uses his magic to shut down the Zombie horde.
