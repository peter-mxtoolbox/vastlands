Sha tu has a sweet ride that is infused with some essence of his wife which is a large six legged vehicle type thing. Noh wut

Bozin Black: Own's Mothers Milk, a club near the hollows. It is a bar / night club that has live performers. There is a huge statue of a lady with her arms cradling the entrance. The milk is now starting to flow out of more than just the private teats located in the booths and it is eerily silent. We see eddies in the milk where we can imagine creatures are moving about under the surface. In giant letters we see “Coward” carved into the wall. 

  

Sha tu looks around to see what he can see. He starts up the stairs. “It is not for you to decide…” Loud booms explode from the end of the hall - some weapon hurls shells that while they miss him, the exploding walls turn into shrapnel that hits Sha tu. Then the noise ceases. His purple blood mixes with the milk making a beautiful pattern. 

  

Spider Mendel runs up the stairs and spiders around legs blurred with speed. There is a nautilus shaped thing mounted on the ceiling with a barrel coming out of it. Somehow it cannot track him. There are bodies on the floor in the hallway. Mendel goops the gun to disable it. He makes his way to the next doorway, made of huge breasts. 

  

The wall is lined with Toupees made of exotic hair each in their own small gilded cages. There is a massive desk at the far end. Behind the desk is an obscenely large portrait covered with a velvet curtain which is covered with Bozin Blacks brains. Saito collects as much of the record keeping as he can which is not covered in blood. Mendel and Siljak grab the portrait. Sha Tu sees a black shoebox sized object just below the surface of the milk. He finds an elegant spyglass of philagreed ebony. He looks through it immediately. Using the spyglass he can tell that Bozin’s plastic helmet thing was to protect him from elements beyond the vale. Magic shell, aka, Head Candy, aka Bonbon

  

As he goes to move the curtain aside, Siljak sees his own face on the painting. Spider Mendel takes a peek. 

He sees some multi-armed warrior with four swords. Mendel is particularly taken with how accurate the anatomy was portrayed.

Mendel hoists the portrait and takes it out after grabbing Bozin’s teeth (old habits die hard). Sha Tu takes a toupee and sops up some milk. He puts the milky hair into his oilskin bag to bring to the eater of names. 

  

Dinner Time

Grosnic introduced us to the eater of names. We will meet at the end of the Last Drop.

All of the cultists are acting as servers tonight. You can feel the jealousy in the air. It is so thick. There is a sinkhole in the dining room with the table at the lowest point. The eater is very formal. They offer Mendel the opportunity to borrow a mouth. They then ask if he would rather something more orthodox or more adventurous. Mendel chooses to be adventurous. Two cultists come out from the back carrying a large bone colored plate so heavy it requires “team lift”.

Tendrils shoot out and sort of bond with Spider Mendel’s thorax. “Is this suitable”?

  

Aperitif : a tiny golden cup with an eye-dropper and the smallest amount of liquid, and then a large black block that smokes. You drop a bit of liquid on the block and then it smokes. You place your head over the smoke and consume it with your eyes. 

  

Hors d'œuvres: - ![[New Assets/Meat Fruit.png|meat fruit]]. It’s like a lot of little pig-bats that you tear off the teats. 

  

We offer the milk toupee served over the Geode Skull wrapped up as Hair-o-peno poppers. 

  

The Eater explains what the Nightmare Burger challenge is. You get to hold one. You can spend that one on any roll in the future into a 12. The challenge is to walk through the gallery and view each of the paintings. 

  

Main Course: She refers to the Secret Oasis as “The place where the black stars hang.” In order to access it we must do something for her. We must approach the holy mountain. A stalactite-like mineral thing comes down from the ceiling. It is topped with an eye and some noodly appendages. We lift the domes off of plates given to us by servers. Underneath are small automatons. They come to life and climb up the “thing” and hack off the tentacles for us to eat. Siljak’s soldiers return to him the eye.

A strange organic chalice is placed on the table. She places a tablet into her forehead and then emits some milk-like liquid. Silkjak and Sha Tu also do this. 

  

Siljak wins the honor of taking her tongue to the Holy Mountain.

He asks about a thing that could return his taste. She says there is a tree in the Tears of Light and that the fruit of that tree can return his taste.

  

Dessert: Crystal hive mind. First we wash. She hits it with a small hammer. The wasps inside start to twitch. Then they come out. They sting each of us in the throat. We begin to shrink. She then eats us.

  

Did we see / experience new shit? Yes

Did we reach a new destination? No

Did we eat or cook some new or interesting stuff? Yes
