![[Idsovak.png|250]]
[[Idsovak]]

She is a stitch-witch and travels with a baba-yaga style building (it‚Äôs about the size of a shed and is on mechanical chicken legs).¬† Elevated Descendents of the Needle (Stitch-Witches) merge machines with flesh. She‚Äôs on the road to carve her own path from the howl mind. She is following the path of Pussy Complexus (PC has become a legendary historical personality). She is an apostate stitch-witch going against doctrine/dogma. She has read all of PC‚Äôs forbidden texts.¬†

Idsovak is always looking for meat for experimentation, so she knows Margrave. She just kind of shows up, but to us she‚Äôs always been there‚Ä¶ even though she hasn‚Äôt.

[[RausRaus of Haus Rohaus]]

The head Spark has spoken with [[Margrave Purpureo|Margrave]] and they have decided to switch up the lineup. Lantern Head (2nd Brother) has been removed from the team and replaced with Psu. He is noticeably disappointed.¬†

The team gears up to travel. [[Margrave Purpureo|Margrave]] is looking over our gear. [[Nopal]] shows off his needles. [[Margrave Purpureo|Margrave]] nods dubiously and moves on to [[58263|Ken]]. Ken shows off his stun rod. Inexplicably, [[Idsovak]] is in line too. No one questions it. She shows off her small traps and snares along with medical/taxidermy tools. [[Psu]] has a moleskin notebook. Margrave is disappointed in our wares, he calls to the Sparks and they bring over a large jade chest. ‚ÄúI am a man of actions. I follow the [[Praxa of the Good Guns]]. This is all there is. In this world I have come to learn that we are surrounded by these cave people with boomsticks. Garbage weapons from an uncivilized culture.‚Äù He holds up a weapon that looks like a treble clef. "The good guns have a pedigree. Good guns beget Good Guns. There is a lineage (he‚Äôs a gun supremacist). Swift and Bitter Sunset is the name of this gun and beneath it are smaller versions of the guns (its pups)."

Once in hand, the guns feel like they‚Äôre breathing. They expand and contract ever so slightly. They have a rhythm, a respiration. You want to match your breathing to the gun.¬†

 [[Margrave Purpureo|Margrave]] takes them out for target practice. It‚Äôs all crab carcasses that [[Cage]] set up. `We all S!` Margrave is impressed. There is a secondary shootout between [[Nopal]] and [[58263|Ken]]. Ken wins. `He gets a hold that will allow him to: deal MAX damage on a hit.

The Praxa of the Good Guns means:

-   The right tools for the job   
-   It is of critical importance to get the drop on your opponent (the secret is setting up an ambush, we don‚Äôt want to fight fair).

The teams moves out into the darkness of the desert in [[T@B1TH@]] (the Baba-Yaga/Chicken Shack). The movement of the shack involves a NordicTrac style device inside. It isn‚Äôt actually connected to anything, T@B1TH@ just likes to feel like she‚Äôs being driven. Aside from the NordicTrac, the interior of T@B1TH@ is a featureless cube but there are fleshy bits‚Ä¶ sometimes they get goosebumps.


The team heads out to the rendezvous point and are waiting for contact. There are lights that appear in the sky (despite the infinite blackness). Lights come closer to the ground and they appear to be human skulls carried by luminous jellyfish (umbrella sized). When they reach the ground they spit out the skulls and they shatter on the ground.

Travelers must don the Jellyfish for their trip. They still have to walk (or ride in our case) all the while listening telepathically why **Jelly-life is Best Life** (they make some good points). The team members wear the jellys like a hood, they sting a bit. [[Psu]] is enamored with all of this, and she details it in her notebook. The Jelly that is on her is a little disappointed with her prosthetic head.¬†


They are **Jellevangelists**.

#### Propaganda Points: They call you non-life.¬†
-   You don‚Äôt have to eat. Eating and preparing food is disgusting.¬†
-   Jelly life is open and honest. You can literally see right through each other. There is no deception. (Ken is making notes about how to make corporate life more like Jelly-life).
-   Bones are a liability. Live a no-bone life. They make you ridgid‚Ä¶ be relaxed. That‚Äôs why they crush the skulls.
-   Jelly is strong, Jelly is open and honest, Jelly is Verile, Jelly never hungers, Jelly is austere

[[58263|Ken]] has been offered **Jellification**. He thinks it‚Äôs best for business to accept Jellification as a whole, but he‚Äôs conflicted whether these two things are in conflict. He thinks real hard and accepts Jellification. Ken dissolves like Obi-wan Kenobi leaving nothing but a smear; the horrifying stain of non-life. What is left are garbage bones. Ken pops back up and is back exactly like he was (to us, but has been Jellified beneath).¬†

[[Nopal]] tries to feed Ken‚Äôs bones to his cactus. It spits that shit out. [[Psu]] very delicately collects the bones. [[58263|Ken]] says ‚ÄúBones are not strong‚Äù.¬†

We are standing at the lip of a crater. There is a domed structure at its center with a 20-30 yard doorway. This used to be buried, but is now exposed. It is glistening with viscous liquid and snotsicles covering the door. Bubbles rise to the top and burst. Something has accumulated here. You can smell it. It smells boozy and like ghosts. Like boozy vape (or a fog machine). There is a light fog hanging over it.¬†

[[58263|Ken]] detects mandatory fun.

[[Psu]] is kneeling at the edge of the crater. She sticks her head into the fog. Her weird head is porous and sucks in fog as a sample. Her body clicks and clacks and expels the fog. ‚ÄúDefinitely a biological secretion.‚Äù¬† She thinks the fog may be scatalogical in nature (peristalsis). There is a bit of a pond/lake.¬†

[[Idsovak]] asks [[Psu]] it is safe. She doesn't think it is toxic or corroding. ‚ÄúYou'll be safe, but it may be unpleasant.‚Äù Psu doesn‚Äôt give a fuck and just wades in. Margrave thinks this could be a latrine or the refuse of a single giant creature. Looking around, this is the only one of its kind nearby. After examining the swamp Psu and [[Margrave Purpureo|Margrave]] are very drunk and it is determined they should stay behind.

Moving through the swamp causes large bubbles to pop up.¬†

```
Roll for effects of the fog
-   Nopaul: C! - a bit buzzed (-1 forward)   
-   Ken: F! - drunk (he is one big jello-shot). His new body absorbs the inebriant quickly. (DM gets a negative hold against)
-   Idsovak: F! - drunk (DM gets a negative hold against)  
```


They arrive at the doors. `Ken sizes up the sitch. F!` Ken tries to just pass through the door. It does not work. He does not realize that it does not work and continues to try. [[Idsovak]] approaches to help, Ken turns to speak to her. ‚ÄúOne thing the Jellys didn‚Äôt tell you about‚Ä¶ is the tingle.‚Äù Ken offers her a proboscis‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúDo you feel the tingle? Jelly-life is Tingle". Idsovak starts to see the true value of Jelly-life. Despite being drunk, she is dangerously interested in Jelly-life.

[[Nopal]] drags [[Lorde]] across the metal of the door trying to to divine something. `Nopal sizes up the sitch C!` Amid the nails on a chalkboard screeches, he notices the doors appear to be sealed shut from the inside and the seal has held. However, there is a small gap in the doors that has been filled by something that isn‚Äôt hard like the door; Like organic tissue.¬†

[[Idsovak]] is a Stitch-witch (she merges organic material with inorganic material). Using her skills she can get enough purchase in the door to be able to force it open (using her taxidermy style tools). `F!` As she is tickling the tissue, she triggers a mechanism that swings open the doors causing¬† an explosive decompression that sucks the team in and they are now riding a wave of slime.
