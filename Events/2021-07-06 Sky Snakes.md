üêê: [[Danton]]

![[Pussy Complexus.png]]

[[Siljak]] is still coming down off his [[wizard bone]] high. He is weary.

[[Grosnic]] collects some [[Sky Vipers|Sky Viper]] venom in his old hat. Siljak and [[Y.A.M.S.]] are suffering the effects of the sky vipers and seem to have tendencies to amble towards the sky. 

[[Pussy Complexus|Jaeger]] drives to the edge of the precipice and thinks for a while. Eventually [[Mendel]] goes over to chat with him. Afterwards the device ejects a brain onto the ground. It then drives back over and informs us that Jaeger is no longer representing them. They no longer have a single entity speaking for them. They now want to be acknowledged as [[Pussy Complexus]]. 

PC says that they can bring [[Barol]] into their collective and help control her force field. The field can protect us from the sky vipers. We allow this. PC drives up and smooshes Barol and the nasty [[Courtesans|Courtesan]] remains together. A field is projected about 10 feet around us protecting us from future snake dive bombs.

[[The Silence]] is a legendary pirate from the redlands who has disappeared. The map [[Grosnic]] has he can tell that it is in her hand because there is a spot that is blank which is her signature. We decide to follow the map and head towards the mark left by silence. 

During campfire time, PC offers to ‚Äúenhance‚Äù Food Truck.

Encounter: Danton goes to investigate some rustling he hears near ‚ÄúFood Truck‚Äù during the night. It‚Äôs Spider Gulek and he‚Äôs been eating our supplies. He has the Gulek book.

We decide to spend a week doing some impromptu foraging since [[Gulek]] ate all our shit. Siljak is gonna study the Gulek book. Spiders are gonna try to get some under aerolith mushrooms. [[Rohaus]] is setting up his reverse polarity snake trap. 

Gulek gets four sacks of mushrooms. Some are a little wet with spittle. Mendel also got some dry mushrooms. 

So our plan for sky snakes was for Rohaus to shake his ass and squirt some juice all around to attract them. Then Cat Bus turns on a reverse polarity force field to contain them. We catch 8 snakes and were able to process them over the next two days. We get four snake meat and four venom sacks. 

Siljak prepares to perform the ritual of transformation. He scribes circles around each of spider Guleks hands. Danton holds his last hand and places it down as the last ring is drawn. He is transformed back into Gulek.¬† His head is upside down.
