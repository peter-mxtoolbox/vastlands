Previous Adventure: [[2021-07-21 The Barista]]

August 4, 2021
üêê: [[Grosnic]]

We are on the southern rim of [[Golo]]. We have to keep in mind that this area is very against anything smacking of necromanticism in nature. While the others were adventuring, [[Danton]] was hanging with all the others and ended up teaching them caravan songs including, ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt nobody lost but me.‚Äù [[Pussy Complexus]] loves to sing. When it goes into rest mode, it lights up like a lava lamp and the [[Courtesans]] are mesmerized. [[Gulek]] pulls Danton aside to have a conversation. One on one, he becomes much more animated than in group settings. He tells Danton that he feels his electrical powers have been increasing while spending time out here in [[Golo]]. He has started to be able to communicate with [[Barol]] in electrical ways. While getting close to her, he has learned a secret that we should know. She is old, ancient tech. She was not built to be a shield, but rather a bomb. 

[[Rohaus]] comes up with a plan for how we might be able to smuggle our drugs into Golo. We are going to leave the skeletons behind and have the courtesans carry the [[palanquin]]. [[Danton]] and CatBus are going to work together to enhance the last courtesan to appear pregnant and implant our massive amount of Wizard Bone into her.

[[Grosnic]] levels up and adds True Wizard. When he obtained the heart compass, this new skill became active. He has gotten [[Veda of the Iron Symphony]]. His eyes are beginning to change appearance. 

[[Mendel]] goes back up to [[Characters/The Barista]] and asks her to add serrations to his legs to make them more deadly as weapons. He trades her the skeleton halflings. She scores serrations on both sides of some of his legs to make them extra nasty, but it was a painful experience. We hear screams from far away.   

[[Siljak]] works with the courtesans to try to teach them how to work together to carry the palanquin. One of the courtesans falls off the edge of the aerolith so we only have three left to carry it. We are up one spare courtesan robe. 

Danton eats some [[wizard bone]]. The operation was a complete success and he takes no damage from performing the magic. Vess is simply radiant. 

Siljak, Danton, and Grosnic put on the [[Yellow City Road Agents]] armor. Mendel takes the three sets of travelers plate armor and cobbles together one set of spider armor. 

As we start to move the caravan out, Barbarista calls out to Grosnic, ‚ÄúFind Silence or Die.‚Äù

We head out after eating some rations. We experience more of the [[Golo]] electric light orchestra. We are buffeted by currents of air when the crackling is active. We come across an area with small boulders.

![[Boulder Crabs.png]]

As we get nearer we realize that they are not boulders but giant creatures with crab-like claws on them. They are going through the rubble there. In the distance we hear a boom. We can feel the pressure wave and it is nothing like the near constant thunder we hear frequently here. The creatures swell a bit and drift off after the boom. We decide to get a move on. 

We see something like a signal flare go up in the distance. We ask [[Sia]] if she knows what it could be. She says it is a signal for assistance. We decide to go and investigate, but decide against signalling back ourselves. 

We come up to an aerolith that looks different, that it has been blown up. We see a giant miner looking figure. It is looking down toward another aerolith upon which are three more figures. They are giant. 

![[Bridgers.png]]

Sia tells us that they are [[Bridgers]] from [[Sky Bridge]]. It appears that they are stranded apart from each other. It also seems that they have uncovered a small tunnel opening with their explosion. One lifts it‚Äôs helmet and we can see under it. Their faces are very flat, and they are sometimes referred to as blockheads. Another has a gigantic shotgun. 

[[Rohaus]] yells out, ‚ÄúYou look lost‚Äù. We talk with them a while and work on a way to try to help their friend. 

Hullen is the name of the bridger we are conversing with. Mendel offers to assist. We can smell chocolate from their giant mugs of hot beverage. We can also smell the booze coming through.

Once we can get the one to safety, the deal is that we split anything we find in the hole 50/50.

The destination is about 75 feet away at a higher elevation. 

Our plan is to combine Grosnic‚Äôs [[Veda of the Iron Symphony]] and [[Gulek|Gulek's]] growing power of electrical manipulation; we hope to try to rebuild the bridge. The bridgers take off their armor and [[Grosnic]] rips it apart to build a metal rope bridge to the aerolith with the stranded bridger. Gulek uses his power to try to align the bridge to the forces that hold the bridges together. He yells that it won‚Äôt hold for long. 

[[Rohaus]] tears off across the bridge pulling a line from [[Mendel]]. He gets to the other side and gives the bridger the spider line as well as a rope attached to the higher aerolith with a grapple. The grapple is not holding well. Hulga makes her way across safely. Rohaus starts to explore the tunnel. He comes to a set of doors. They are asymmetrical and covered with etched symbols and shapes. He can sense magic on the other side of the door. He can also see marks from where the last beings to open the door marred it. It is a magic he has never smelled before. After asking us for any ideas, he decides to go back and try to get into the area. He makes it through the door. He sneaks his way down being extra careful. He sees a blue light in the distance and some dead bodies on the ground. After careful investigation he figures out that the figures are those of people attempting to access the very heavy metal door across from the light. They were vaporized and their shadows were burned into the door. When describing this to the group, a voice deep in Mendel says that this is the [[Veda of the Cosmic Architects]]. The voice is from the demon trapped in the spider. 

End of session:
-   New discovery? Yes.
-   New shit? Yes.
-   Grow Drug Empire? Yes. Maria full of Grace. 

Mendel gets to level for next time‚Ä¶
