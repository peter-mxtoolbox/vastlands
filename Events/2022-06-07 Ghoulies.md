Ken wrapped around a Machine Ghoul. While wrapped around the Machine Ghoul he has evolved into Kenny G

‚Üê

The Team is going to palaver with the Jellies and request it sort out our impending Machine Ghoul issues.

-   [How are we going to convince the Jellies this is a good idea?¬† How will we aid them? What method do we propose?]
    

  

Idsovak first meets with the Jellies explaining to them that when you convince machine flesh it is alive, this is the essence of Veda of The Abmortal Doctor. Even machines want the best life. Kenny G goes on to explain that the Machine Ghouls are obsessed with hair. Then he explains what hair is and shows them a sample. He arms the Jelly with some of the hair they recovered. During the ensuing melee, Scab is going to read from the Blue Heresy Scrolls‚Ä¶ it couldn‚Äôt hurt, right?

  

S!

  

After parsing the advice from the team, the Jellys form a dome around the bunker, the Machine Ghouls are picked apart as the exit‚Äìthey didn‚Äôt stand a chance. After the last one has fallen, the crater is littered with Machine Ghoul carcasses like the crabs on the beach.¬†

The Jellys quickly establish dominion over all the Machine Ghouls. These new hybrids are called Goolies. They maintain their Jelly form replacing their former human skulls with Machine Ghoul parts (not just heads, but feet, hands, etc).

  

The team have borne witness to the birthing of the holy diad. The Jelly have reached a new phase of enlightenment. They are blissed out.

  

The team re-enters the bunker (with Mongrave & Psu). Slime is still pouring down the open hatch in the center of the room, but it has been slowed by Machine Ghoul carcasses. On entering, Kenny G notices another one of the giant hieroglyphics from before. He can read it now very clearly. In giant block stencil it reads: Subsurface Esoteric Accumulator Array 17.¬†

  

The descent is fairly easy. At the bottom of the ramp Kenny G finds another sign, wiping caked mold and slime from it it reads: Caution, Nanite Inhalation Hazard. Use Proper Protection (there is a visual of human lungs containing snowflakes). Jelly Life is strong, so Kenny G is not susceptible to this. Idsovak has a ventilator and Scab is immune to environmental effects (those tentacles filter quite well) Nopal grabs the remains of a faceplate from a Machine Ghoul head and wears it for protection.¬†

  

The bottom of the shaft opens up into a labyrinthine tunnel system. An ambient blue glow radiates off the shaped stone surfaces (think concrete) lighting the surroundings. There is a lot of wreckage down here, smashed bits from Demorzanno‚Äôs place as well as bits of Machine Ghoul and unknown detritus. Demoraznno floats about lamenting his lost things. There is a thrum, a booming vibration coming from deep within. It pulses like an arrhythmic heartbeat. It¬† feels like the tunnels are alive.

  

The team is Exploring the Labyrinth. `Custom move, like Trophy. 10+ Gain 1 Hold & Find 1 treasure. 7-9: Choose 1 hold or 1 treasure. 6-: You fucked up. Turn in 5 hold to reach destination`

  

Nopal clearly knows what is going on here and needs to lead the way. He looks to Lorde¬† to help navigate (Lorde hasn‚Äôt steered him wrong yet). He pulls Lorde from its satchel, and it has changed. Its number of spines has diminished and it has turned blue. It is clearly breathing and seems a bit excited. Lorde speaks to Nopal (but only to him). It is pleased to be awake and wants affection. Nopal is happy to reciprocate. They head in a seemingly random direction and the team follows. F!¬†![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/EfofUE6RWXMYF2op6LCxO5zPLM2VA21bII7h03VORzIGyBP7OX59D00qSjOqqhqDU0GTHGPK7Tq-LomDBV8Qw2huvfPNQgAfX0aOxO6yjIboQMU7_rF5YIUALyc8h2Vb2LnibqcCYpIvNlXCgAbTXA)

  

There is a pile of Machine Ghoul carcasses blocking the tunnel. They look like they‚Äôve been here for a while. Perhap the slime slowly pushed them causing a build up here. Nopal leads the way over the pile closely consulting Lorde as they climb. As they crest the top of the pile, the carcasseses explosively decompose shooting a cloud of metallic dust into the air exposing everyone to Nanites. The team is sufficiently protected except Nopal [C!] but his makeshift face mask has thwarted the nanites. [How do you know Lorde has Nanitus?] Lorde on the other has shifted his focus toward some of the metal items on Nopal. It is nibbling at them.

  

Ken is deciphering signs as they recover from the explosion. [C! Takes Hold]. There is a sign that says Arcanorganism Containment Vault (as in Arcane Organism). They head in that direction.

  

Scab is using the Articulating Eye. [C! Takes Hold] The eye filters out the blue light revealing neon conduits behind the walls. There is fluid in them that moves in conjunction with the thrum.¬†

  

Idsovak, using the Veda of the Abmortal Doctor, ascertains that this ‚Äúbloodflow‚Äù that Scab has discovered should lead them to the ‚Äúheart‚Äù of the facility. [C! Takes Treasure] There is some damage in the wall with cooled blue blood around it. The damage reveals a chewed mechanical artery containing 42 blood diamonds (like Nopal found above) [worth $500 to a vampire or golem-mancer or $100 to anyone else‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs $4200 or $23500]. Idsovak pulls the artery and ties a knot in the tube to carry it like a giant sock. She pokes in a leak hole to release the constant build up of blue diamond blood.

  

Upon realizing this facility may be alive, Nopal uses his Mule Speak/Beast Mastering skills to communicate with the facility. [C! Take Hold] Through divine intervention (and basic common sense) he senses a convergence of the conduits/arteries.

  

Moving forward toward the heart of the facility, Kenny G is keeping an eye out for more signs. [S! Hold + Treasure]. Slogging through the dregs of effluvia he spots a glowing patch. This turns out to be a glowing lucite polygon with a hard light map of the whole facility. [+3 hold, completed labyrinth +2 treasures].

  

Down a side passage, the team comes across a sealed room with a sign reading: Arcanorganism Lab Access. Slumped in the corner surrounded by Machine Ghoul carcasses is a decapitated morbidly obese body. Upon closer inspection, it is actually a specialized suit (a fat suit‚Äìpower armor encased in synthetic blubber) covered in nozzles with a happy face emoji on the front. There is a desiccated body inside and a key card on the belt. Kenny G immediately sees the value in this item and pours himself (complete with internal Machine Ghoul) inside [+2 armor].

Using the key card, the Lab is opened. Inside they find evidence of the shocking true nature of all Machine Ghouls. Through documents and schematics it is revealed that all Purple Machine Ghouls were once a part of a giant chimeric organism (a magic AI) with its parts stretched throughout the facility. For reasons still unclear, it tore itself apart and it recreated itself into the Machine Ghouls (on purpose or not is also unclear). The only remaining part in its original form is the heart. This whole system is self replicating but there are limits to what it can do. Idsovak thinks she could get the Goolies to reform the original AI organism. ALL Purple Machine Ghouls, wherever you find them, originated here. There are likely other facilities like this.

  

Kenny G is contemplating Jelly Life. How can he reconcile Goolie life with Corporate Life? There must be synergy there. His Machine Ghoul fidgets, causing bubbles to form in his Jelly.

  

A path leads us to the center of the facility. As the team gets closer, every pulse of the thrum is visceral. In the center of a giant room is the Voamish heart of the Arcanorganism. It is suspended above a lake of blue blood covered in oozing tears. It looks like it has been cannibalized and the reason is the glow of the blue blood diamonds inside.

  

Demorzanno is very excited. ‚ÄúThey were holding out on me. So this is their stash!‚Äù .¬†

  

Lorde is wriggling in Nopal‚Äôs arms. It communicates with him. If it were to be put inside the heart, it could attain its rebirth and true form. Nopal is excited about the prospect and starts walking towards the heart.¬†

  

Scab begins gathering up scattered blood diamonds around the room [100].

  

Idsovak is enamored with the possibilities of the heart.¬†¬†

  

No one really notices that Nopal is walking toward the heart with Lorde outstretched. Just as he is about to put Lorde in, the team asks if this is the best idea. He says by adding Lorde to the heart, it will create more diamonds and help the heart heal itself. This is the best way for everyone. He speaks this with such conviction, no one stops him. He places Lorde into the heart and the holes and tears in heart close and it begins to beat. Nopal‚Äôs spines retract a final time and he coughs up a ball of cactus spines. It disintegrates in his hands. He turns to the team, wiping tears of joy from his eyes, his purpose served. ‚ÄúSo tell me more about this Jelly Life‚Äù.

  

Behind him, Nopal doesn‚Äôt realize the heart has started beating at an increasingly rapid rate. It explodes and 900 blood diamonds rain down around them. Lorde doubles then quadruples in size. It is growing at an exponential rate and will fill this room very quickly. Nopal can still hear it talking. It is reveling in its consumption of the heart and the overload of blood. It plans to regrow the world in its image.

  

Nopal is shaken out of his own reverie and runs for the exit alongside Idsovak and Scab.

  

During this whole exchange, Kenny G was looking through the slop for his stuff. [S!] He finds all his gear and he runs to catch up with his companion.

  

Kenny G is able to navigate the team out of the compound quickly using the hard light map. Idsovak is knocked off balance by Scab, using cane in one hand and articulating eye (fully extended) in the other to gain momentum. [F!] She hits the ground hard and feels the blue blood rise over the level of her mask and it is choking her. Summoning all her strength, lifts up and into a sprint. Her diamond tube catches on a Machine Ghoul carcass, as she pulls free, she sees the tube tear and the diamonds spray, twinkling into the air. If she wants to survive she knows she has to move, but she laments losing the diamonds, not for money, but as ‚Äúheart‚Äù power sources in new machines.¬†

  

The team spills out of the facility and over the lip of the crater. Behind them a giant blue cactus erupts from the ground heading up toward the infinite sky.¬†

  

Reuniting with the Jellys, the team explains that they need to return to their camp. The Jellys admit there‚Äôs nothing to the trip, they just used it as an opportunity to preach Jelly-Life. See historical footnote: The Great Jelly Lie.

  

Scab suggests the Jellys leave with us. Nopal explains that he is a very good cactus farmer and that Lorde has reached apotheosis and will grow to encompass the entire Black Oasis. Idsovak is also interested in merging Jelly Life with Mechanical Life, this is how she will carve her path from the Howl Mind. The Jellys are amenable to all of this.¬†

  

The team returns with the Jellys. The Sparks are a bit alarmed especially when they see Kenny G. Mongag is working on some arts and crafts, but his attention turns to the returning team. Everyone is speaking at once trying to explain how dire the situation is with the expansion of Lorde. 2nd Brother (Lantern Head) is trying to translate on the fly and is getting quite confused. Margrave steps in and relays the story in their language. 2nd Brother just looks dumbfounded, but after a moment he starts shouting orders and gets people moving.

  

The camp is in chaos as everyone hastily loads up to evacuate. Hundreds of Jelly descend upon the camp like stars falling from the sky. The Party Beast is noticeably anxious. While it has lived longer than near anything in existence and fears nothing‚Ä¶ well, almost nothing.

  

After a chaotic loading the Party Beast convoy leaves the Black Oasis bound for 1000 Fingers.¬†

  
```
Travel through the Oasis F!

-   Cactus comes through?  
-   The Jellys come, but they‚Äôre a bit crazy and start an orgy of assimilation?
-   The MachineGhouls come through without Jellys (they want hair)? ‚Äì selected randomly

```


The team emerges from the inky blackness of the Black Oasis into the rainbow surf of the shallow technicolor sea on the outskirts of 1000 Fingers. Behind them they see the Purple Machine Ghouls (in pieces) have come through, but the Jellys did not. It looks as though the pieces are merging into a giant entity. It is a Kaiju Ghoul. A KaiGool.¬†

In front they see the towers coming up all around.
