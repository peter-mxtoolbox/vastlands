2021-09-01 (Arrival in GOLO)

GOAT = Rohaus

  

Danton became addicted to Wizard Bone. Siljak reveals to us that he actually knows Kung Fu. He had to give it up when he took up his staff. 

The folks of Golo are chanting, “It’s coming back up!” and a giant head with glowing eyes rise up in the distance above the sea.

The “dusters” are road crew that have glass horns pulling carts with supplies of graphite-like dust that they spread over the bridges. They also have portable shrines with them so they are sort of like construction workers / monks.

Rohaus asks one of these dusters what they can tell us about the floating head. “We don’t know what it was. It’s some sort of divine shrine. We feed our criminals to Old Nod. Glowing eyes are new though.”

  

Sia tells us that she is headed down to The Last Drop, a fancy restaurant that buys her coffee. She’ll be there for a little while, but then she plans on heading back out to Barbarista.

 We see some rodent-like creature for an instant, but after spotting Siljak, it tears off in what looks like fear and is gone. We did notice that it has hand-feet. 

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

We approach the customs house and see the agents processing people. They are shrouded in armor that looks almost like muscle tissue, but is in fact made of stone. Their movements are labored. They have bright orbs floating over their heads that occasionally have an iris appear and which look around.![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/oC8Koo-tJsWChamUOjEou_obDzNpZeHrpCV1k7VqxeiU_EZIQ52hFo4bZoWO5xps3jt0-Q1FKr5tESswt30esEXS5ny49JpjKMV6M73XKjuOI73E-gj1ueymapnSIgJkdFYAtjIZ4Az8UOfPcg)

  

“Welcome to the free city of Golo.” He tells us of the rules regarding undead and other contraband. They are interested and ask about Pussy Complexus (of course). They wave the palanquin through. 

  

A skeletal arm falls off of BBQ where it has been wedged under a saddlebag. Mendel kicks it away toward some other travelers, some weird ass nomad trade makers. 

  

Just as we were clearing the agents, one says offhand to Grosnic, “Your friends got here a few days ago. I think they went down to the Clutches.”

  

We near the GutMarket and we can smell the grilling meat and hear the sizzle. An argument breaks out at one of the food stands. Some young people are hassling the vendor for “selling your poison to us. Hey! Nobody eat this shit.”  They had conspicuous pierced ankles with jangling metal bits in the holes. 

  

Rohaus asks the vendor about the youth. He calls them troublemakers. The people who live here are called Golomites. The ruling class is the House of Plenty. They provide the food. 

  

There is a bad-ass guy that has like teeth outside his mouth and he is leaning against an articulated spear. 

  

We take some time to rest up, carouse, and perhaps make some deals. 

  

Rohaus locks eyes with Tessana, an alluring grand company saboteur rocking on somebody else’s dime  on a dangerous mission to destabilize Golo.t

  

The merchant who runs the shop is from Thousand Fingers and has an oil-like sheen from drinking “Glow”, a beverage from that region that is poison for almost all other life forms. Siljak wanders over to an alcove that is off to the side containing tears of light. 

  

Spider Mendel uses Noblesse Oblidged to get some preferential pricing. 

  

We trade our yellow agent gear (armor and boomsticks) for hair shirts

Danton picks up healing lotion and SIljak gets Tears of Light.

  

Danton asks the shopkeeper about his Beetles to see if he might recognize them or how to re-energize them. He says he had heard about similar items in a place called Thesis. It is a shrine and death works differently there. Some people who are still alive are called dead. 

The beatles are psychopomps: a guide of souls to the place of the dead. “Or we could just sell that shit and get some more crank”

Rohaus and Mendel get up to some illegal cockatrice fights and make off with seven fertilized eggs, one of which is the rare reverse cockatrice. 

  

Grosnic ended up eating at a secret festival made by food cultists. He also got addicted to a spicy drug.

  

Siljak and Danton after a week of careful study. We cheated at a game of chance called cross-shock. Danton implanted some biomechanical cheats into his arms. We won three sturdy carts will with erotic stone pillars to be delivered to the palace of light pulled by golden royale glasshorns. The pillars are worth $2k each in the palace of light. 

  

End of session:

-   New discovery? Negative
    
-   New weird shit? Yes
    
-   Grow Drug Empire? Yes 
    

  

Grosnic needs to think about his stone heart. Rohaus is mixed up with Tessana.
