Previous Adventure: [[Caravan Day]]

April 20, 2021

We see several areas of activity around the crater, the #Ghostwalkers_Yurt  on the crater’s edge, and from time to time we see an inky black tentacle reach over the edge before pulling back into the crater. 

We decide to make an appearance at the Den of the Drug. A haze floats over the place, and people are hanging about. At one vestibule we see a despondent group. Their clothes are drab and their skin is pale, but their jade jewelry stands out, and this marks them as being Greenlanders. 

[[Rasklana]] greets us with armfuls of steaming hot mugs of [[Vampire Wine]]. We drink and ask how she fared selling the wine she won from us. She says she sold it here for a good price. We ask her if she would try selling our remaining wine to the proprietor as well. She agrees so long as we hire her as hired muscle for the next leg of our journey at $50 per week. We agree and she returns with an offer of $115 per case instead of the $125 she got. 

[[Mendel]] goes up to the bar and uses her title to try to get us a better deal. She tells Barlas that she personally vouches for the vintage of this batch. Barlas turns around and updates the menu doubling the price for the patrons and pays us $150 each. We are ingratiated with him now. 

[[Rohaus]] sniffs around for Wizards. He starts talking to a group of pilgrims, doing some tricks and trying to entertain them. They tell him of their plight which is that their leader has gone missing. His trail leads to the north, but they are not fighters, nor do they have money to hire anyone to look for him. He is Celazome, known as [[The Dentist]]. They hand over their tokens of their faith, necromancer teeth (grillz), etched with runes. 

Danton goes up to the [[Crater Maker]] Camp to try to purchase some supplies. After an amazing playing of Hambone the crater makers are delighted and give us 5 sacks of [[Bubble Bread]] for free. 

The group (minus Danton) go into the #Ghostwalkers_Yurt . They see [[Noma Dubium]] and the oddities within. [[Mendel]] and Noma exchange words as she tries to gain an audience with the demon without paying the usual $250 fee. It turns out Noma wants to see what is inside of Mendel as much as she does. She reveals a sarcophagus and Mendel climbs in.  
 
After ingesting Peyote, [[Mendel]] accompanies Noma to the demon. Experiencing the demon leaves a mental (soul) scar on her. She asks the demon, “How is it that I am?”

The demon replies, “You are but a part of a whole. Do you understand?” When Mendel replies that she does not, the chorus laughs and she is told, “You are me.” Mendel breaks the demon when it tries to possess her.

Time to carouse.  [[Rohaus]] sold a dose of the Bone for $250.  We partied hard for the tune of $500

[[Grosnic]]: Found a sweet severed hand in the street. Too bad it was possessed by a demon. Take 1d6 damage (3) plus got 1 XP

[[Siljak]]: Bad luck at the love yurt! Bad case of black sand fleas. No XP is rewarded. You are thrown out of town as a pubic health menace. You gain the weary debalilty. You are contagious for 1d2 weeks

[[Danton]]: Cut off own hand when it got possessed by a demon. -1 maximum life +1 XP New prosthetic hand is hollow wooden hand

[[Rohaus]]: Lost an ass kicking contest with an wizard with two invisible legs

After carousing, and picking up Mendel who has recovered, we head north to try to find [[The Dentist]]. We go north for two days until we see the Dentist from afar. He is carried by four skeletons and flanked by two terribly tall undead golem centaurs next to him. Grosnic called out to him, “Hey Dentist! Your people are looking for you!” but there is no reply. [[Mendel]] also called out trying to parlay as a fellow necromancer. Through the [[Law Necromantic]], Mendel discovers that the “Dentist” is dead.

The centaurs turn and attack the party:

[[Mendel]] uses the [[Law of the Vessel]] against the purple centaur knocking out it’s rear legs. Grosnic ran up to hit a centaur, but it smashed him away and he crashed into one of the mules. 

Rohaus maneuvers around and blasts an arm off the purple centaur with his bolt caster.

[[Rasklana]] distracts the centaur and it raises its arms presenting a larger target. Danton takes careful aim and shoots it in the spine. It crumples dead.

[[Siljak]] uses his badass rifle to shoot the orange centaur. He hits the medallions hanging below it’s mask. 

The centaur comes crashing down on Siljak and Rasklana. He deflects most of the attack but she catches a lance. 

[[Rohaus]] sprints over to the [[Palanquin]] and jumps in. This causes the golem to spin and charge back at him. 

Rasklana and Grosnic tear off after it to tag-team it. He smashes it in the spine killing it. 

We take the two golden masks as war trophies. We examine the [[Palanquin]] and find the dead Dentist sitting in regal robes. He died from overdosing on teeth. We also find a “rod of command” which directs the skeletons carrying the palanquin. We also find a bone folio with Necromantic texts.
