We decide to all join [[Rohaus]] and came up with a plan involving spider venom to lighten ourselves and crab wax to reinforce Mendel‚Äôs web. It did not work very well. 

We are able to pry open the doors to the cave. [[Mendel]] attempts to read the sigils on the walls here. They are constellations and represent a deity. [[Rohaus]] searches around the bodies in front of the door.¬† He discovers a panel behind the orb with matching sigils that he determines will deactivate the trap. He taps a set of them and the light went out and the door opened. The orb immediately started powering back up again and the door closed. Danton, Mendel, and Grosnic ran into the room. There is a pedestal in the middle of the room with a stone sarcophagus on it. The far wall has a huge six eyed stone face on it. There are weird tendrils with pustules on it that are very transparent, out of phase. There is a rumbling sound and a loud crack! [[Danton]] approaches the face to try to feel if there is anything he can detect from it in a spiritual or religious way. The smaller statues are humanoid as well and are all facing the large statue.

[[Grosnic]] looks around the sarcophagus with his stone eyes. It has glyphs that protect it from being seen. He sees some type of mechanism on the door to open it and deactivate the trap. [[Siljak]] and [[Rohaus]] enter the room. Siljak explores the sarcophagus and realizes from the carvings that there is another trap. The lid reads ‚ÄúUnseen but all seeing.‚Äù

[[Danton]] starts to explore the little statue dolls to see what is inside. He gets a handful of Heretic Ash pellets. 

Mendel fashions a strong web rope that the other attach to the lid. They all heave and pull it off. Inside is the corpse of a spindly creature that has been dead for quite some time. It is wearing robes and its face is obscured by a death mask. There is a sweet aroma of warm smell.

Clutched in its hands is some type of rod shaped ornate bifurcated pipe or flute. The tentacles start to phase more into our plane of existence. Mendel reaches in to grab the 
body, but it falls apart and all that is left is a . [[Geode Skull]]

It smells like freshly mown grass. Mendel grabs it.

The face awakens and this giant freaky thing comes out and goes straight toward the sarcophagus. Rohaus attempts to grab the mask and put it on. He is invisible to the monster. Grosnik grabs at the flute. Whatever it is, he realizes upon picking it up, how heavy and dense it is. 

The tentacles attack our heroes. Mendel has two on him, he dodges one and when the other attacks, a part of the floor falls away. As one attacks Siljak, another section of floor falls away. Grosnic rolls away from the one near him. 

Siljak makes a run for it. He passes through a partially phased tentacle. He is now hazy. 

  

Danton runs up from behind the six-eyes and slides up behind him. He wipes the suspension-cube out from his backpack and opens it. The monster is immobilized. 

  

Grosnic and Rohaus make their way toward the door. Danton sets the cube down near the stone face. 

  

Siljak whacks the orb with his gun-staff using his knowledge of lasers. The beam goes off and refracts off the cube. Everybody just runs out of the place after all the tentacles are vaporized. 

  

We all split another viper venom and jump and fire the giant‚Äôs shotgun. Rohaus‚Äôs forehead tattoo changes to ‚ÄúHot Lunch‚Äù just before he fires the gun. Mendel starts shooting out webs in every direction. 

  

The giants are amazed. We hand over 3 ash pellets of the 6 we have. Since there are actually four giants, Danton gives them a fourth pellet. They accompany us to GOLO. 

  

We hear a background sound that sounds similar to a heartbeat. Grosnic‚Äôs heart key stone also starts to beat. It starts to pick up tempo. Several people in GOLO run near the edge of the island and gesture for others to come look. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs back!‚Äù

  

A giant head rises up from the sea.
