Spider Mendel leveled. He takes the mutation of Radula which is a body part that he can spit at enemies from range. Once he does this, it takes some time to regrow.

Tessana

  

Didn’t play. Philip & Pete rolled new dudes.

  

Mendel leveled and took a mutation of a Radula. It allows them to take the waste and the glass inside and form it together like a shard/blade that they can spit for 2d6+2.

  

Danton is considering retiring here in GOLO to start a livery. He has converted the horses and animals into his religion. They are his flock. He saves the horses as folks are headed East and no longer need them.  He is also still hooked on drugs. Also, his heart is literally 3 sizes too big. And he may need to transfer his heart into another body. Danton is giving his scarabs to the remaining 3 adventurers (Grosnic, Siljak, & Mendel).

  

Philip & Peter are rolling up new dudes.

  

Philip:

Woodlander Elf-Touched Trapper > Seeking a Prosthetic Body for Mother > Green Brick with the light and warmth of a Candle

Foreign Object - Once per session, gain 1 XP by making an embarrassing social blunder or blatantly ignoring social norms.

Skills:

Circus Acrobat

Shadow Merchant (maybe he literally traps shadows)

  

Saito:

Metropolitan Accountant Monk > Paintings of a Gorgeous Cyan Seaside > A Grey Cube that weighs 5 times more than lead

-- perhaps it's a riding cube; it's generally very loud, but due to his Aural Corona, it is silent.

Abilities:

Devastator - Roll advantage on damage you deal with melee weapons

Aural Corona - You can produce a zone of silence. You get advantage on all roles requiring stealth.

Skills:

Praxa of the Swords

Navigator of Other Worlds
