üêê: [[Grosnic]]

One week's rest. 

* The old timers take off.
* Time passes:
	* What occurs that lets you know that the cannibal headhunters are amassing on the outskirts of the last story tree?
		* [[Grosnic]]: Sails were popping up over the dunes. They are sand ships. It‚Äôs one giant ship with smaller sand skis around it. The sail has an outline of a wooden mask, it is their sigil. They are like wolves circling.
		* Some folks immediately pack their shit and leave; The merchant laughs it off -- Superstitious fucks, they‚Äôll never come in here. Nothing to fear; we‚Äôre totally safe.
	* There is a sign of slavery common in the [[Yellow Lands]]. [[Siljak]] says the symbol is a barbed wire bicep tattoo. The merchant does not have it. Why is barbed wire significant? The whips are made of barbed wire.
	* [[Gulek|Gulek the pretender]] was cocooned by the glass spider and brought back to Gulek Prime‚Äôs yurt. As he reads, sequences of letters will come off the page and on to his arm. He is completely indifferent to the pirates.
	* Theory: [[The Dentist]] is still sprouting teeth at an alarming rate. We think these teeth are mini [[Wizard Bone]]. You have to replace an existing tooth with one.
	* We head toward the Main Entrance of the [[Story Tree]]

The whole tree is stone-like, but in the shape of a tree. It is a malleable stone (hence it changes). [[Rohaus]] is doing some comparison investigation to determine if the boulders surrounding the tree are from the Tree or something else (perhaps the Aerolith that collided with it)... it absolutely is part of the tree. Our working theory is the hands in the tree are literally pulling bits of it out and tossing them on the ground. Perhaps the tree is hurt and needs some help.

* [[Rohaus]] rubs some sap (we gathered from the [[Creatures/Bone Tree|UnionTree]]) on the Story Tree. He feels some vibrations when he reaches out to the tree. When he applies the sap, the tree stops vibrating.
* We apply sap laden cloth to our bodies and enter the tree.
* What do we see that is an obvious deterrent/defense
	* Vines hanging from above and we can see small animal skeletons entwined in the vines. They come for us, but retreat when they touch the sap. We are all touched by them, like a blind person feeling your face.
	* Once inside we see a hollow tower going up, with many branches (corridors) going off the trunk. Shafts of light randomly appear and disappear like shafts of light in a forest. Rather odorless and echo-y on the inside. [[Siljak]] shouts and the echo bounces around everything for some time. 
	* There is a stairwell of stone that goes up. Was it carved or grown? Can‚Äôt tell.
	* The ascent is arduous and a ritual in and of itself. 
* We be climbin‚Äô
	* As we climb the stairs we hear an echoing thunder from above. Giant boulders are falling and knocking shit around (they are annihilating stairs and are devastating). We have to jump out of the way.
	* [[Siljak]] is focused on the walls and it passes him by, no worries.
	* [[Grosnic]] takes 5 dam; [[Rohaus]] & [[Mendel]] are in a precarious spot, hanging off the edge of the steps. Siljak scoops up Rohaus.
	* Mendel falls and is able to recover and land on a lower landing. Taking minor damage.
* We reach a landing where we can explore.
* As we reach the landing there is a flickering light from a nearby vestibule.¬† As we follow a narrow tortured corridor we come to a room. In the center of the room there is a corpse. It is skeletal with some pieces of armor around it. There is a translucent jelly-like mass (pizza dough size) draped over the shoulder and cranium of this thing that is glowing like firelight. When we peek in, we sense this pizza-thing move (slightly, not threateningly‚Ä¶ it is animated). 
* Rohaus looks up and at the apex of the dome he can sense some movement. It‚Äôs dark up there, but he‚Äôs pretty certain there‚Äôs something. A slight rustling.
* Neither the body, nor the pizza-thing is magical.
* Rohaus sizes up the sitch on the pizzamoeba
	* This thing is a symbiote (they are genetically created by the [[Red Lands|Redlanders]]).
	* [[Rohaus]] offers himself to it to gain the symbiote. He has a Sistine Chapel moment. There is a flash and threshing spiked tentacles fly down from the ceiling bastard and attack Rohaus trying to remove his arm. It is a creepy two-toned thing (black and hot-pink‚Ä¶ like The Hitman). The symbiote joins with Rohaus and oozes over his hand like a glove. It feels good and fits onto him like a glove. It‚Äôs like the surface of an oil slick (reflective and firelight).
	* It is a [[Firejelly]] (Firesnot) Symbiote
		* Mechanics: It can excrete a rope of sticky flammable mucus (firesnot). It does not automagically ignite itself.
		* The bonding procedure: it extends threads into the central nervous central, meaning you take damage against your MAX HP to bond.
	* Rohaus bonds with it (taking 4 max hp damage). It slowly dissolves the fur on his paw and is covered in an ooze gauntlet (aka [[Firejelly|Snot Fist]]).
	* Rohaus fires a call from beyond Snot Fist up into the dark hole with the Hitman. [[Grosnic]] lights it up.
		* The beast falls from the ceiling writing in agony in a burst of flaming fettuccine. It dies a horrible death.
	* [[Mendel]] investigates. The beast has burned down and it is a wire or a filament. It lashes out and strikes Mendel and falls apart. 
		* The Hitman is NOT biological.
	* Did the dead person die from the trap? 
		* No. There is evidence on the bones of blunt force trauma. Inconsistent with the filament. The body was brought here. The body was dead but the Pizzamoeba did its best to defend his host.
* Onward up the spire.
	* We are high enough that falling is lethal damage (100+ feet).
	* **Petromancy** - wizardry of stone manipulation. 
	* We are starting to encounter the graffiti slowly and organically, but instead of carved in, it is protruding (in relief) like scar tissue on the walls.
	* [[Grosnic]] sees something that moves him
		* There is a lady pirate (rare in the Redlands) that wears a white sash around her eyes that is sewn into her face. There is an inscription that he sees relating to it. There is an impression of her, like a drawing of her face. She‚Äôs called [[The Silence]]. Her legend is that she‚Äôs sneaky and you don‚Äôt know she‚Äôs there until she‚Äôs on you. Every pirate looks up to her. Grosnic is awed by knowing that she may have been here.
		* The imagery that he sees begins to degrade/deteriorate/warp before his eyes. This happens infront of all of us (it isn‚Äôt specific to a dream state or something that Grosnic is having).

A Situation Occurs:

![[Story Tree Beginning.png]]

This is the heart of the tree. There are bits of graffiti and language that are degrading/etc before our eyes as we walk through the space. We also hear a pulsing/thrumming, like an arrhythmic heartbeat. We catch a glimpse of this amophic thing. 

![[Story Tree Middle.png]]

It is pulsing like an imposter heart. This thing is similar to the Hitman (wire/filament thing)... or like a Vome. This thing knows we‚Äôre here‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs mushroom-like protrusions are getting tumescent (engorged). This thing is hanging and anchored in place (but there are tentacles and things floating around). The TREE entrance vines are not an extension of this.

FIGHT (Heart of Darkness):

* Grosnic & Rohaus run around to try to get to the top. They are attacked by things similar to the Hitman. The Hitman tries to knock them off the ledge, but unsuccessfully.
* Heart of Darkness echoes psycho reverberations into the area (Scanners-style).
	* Siljak‚Äôs psychic helmet helps, but he still takes damage.
	* Mendel tries to use strain, still unsuccessful. 
		* [[Mendel]] **dies**.
		* As Mendel's body is shaken apart by the psychic shakes and as her body falls apart she reaches out to grab the citrine stone it too breaks apart and she crumbles. As she dies, the soul of the demon she banished rises out of her and laughs as it dissipates into the ether.
		* She drops an [[azurite crystal]] (but no one will necessarily get it).
* [[Siljak]] runs and engages with the pushing tentacle monster. He knocks back the creature to where it is no longer engaged with any one.
* [[Grosnic]] & [[Rohaus]] cover more ground across the bridge and another Tentacular appears and attacks them. They strain and avoid it. 
* [[Siljak]] uses the [[Veda of the Soulbreaker]] to separate the Tentacular Beast from the Heart of Darkness. Success! The Tentacular Beasts chill out and stop attacking. They just drop and make little to no action. Siljak takes wizard bone and he‚Äôs a [[Dosemaster]] so he mitigates the blood price.
* Heart of Darkness pulls a tentacle that is stuck in the wall of the tree and flops it onto the bridge, then it disgorges ooze to cover the causeway. 

![[Story Tree End.png]]

* You hear the sound of Rice Krispies (snap, crackle, pop).
* The Tentacular Heroes are showing signs of recovery. But not full on.
* [[Rohaus]] symbiotes the bridge & the Heart of Darkness. It starts to foam and sizzle. Grosnic lights it up.
* Tentaculates are getting back up.
* Siljak moves to a neutral locale and shoots the heart with his gun. Strain. The Heart is damaged‚Ä¶ a bit. It‚Äôs oozing smeg from the wound. The heart starts quaking/vibrating and the structural integrity of Siljak‚Äôs location is now in doubt. 
* Grosnic runs toward the heart of Darkness. His skin starts turning into a hard porcelain shell and he‚Äôs going to collide with it and punch into it and activate his [[SparkleFingers]] in the hopes that it kills that fucker! With strain he succeeds!
	* He wins. Grosnic‚Äôs hand get‚Äôs the sparkle as he runs up. And everything goes dark for a moment. Then there is a pulse of light that rebuilds for a moment after the Heart has dropped, but it fades. Nothing is engorged. 

Session end/summation:

* Mendel leaves behind the [[Azurite Crystal]]. Her remains are available, but they don‚Äôt fit back together again. They take what they can.

####End of Session:

* New Destination: Yes!
* Weird & Memorable shit: Yes!
* Grow drug empire: No‚Ä¶ but teeth.
