Goat: Pete/Saito

  

Siljak knows something about these trees that produce the tears of light. Healing vegetable:

Step 1 - Go to the Shame Stables to initiate DONKEY SWITCH

Sha Tu and Siljak prepare to go in. 

They hear a loud gunshot. As they round the corner they see two of the King’s men arguing and picking up some nasty flesh. There’s a large weapon there as well.

    Split Foot     The Pig Hammer

  

Mendel tries to talk his way asking if he could get a quick peek before they deliver him. The commotion was because PH just blew the head off of a slave that had been buried up to their neck in the ground. This distraction allows Spider Mendel and Siljak to get into the stables.

Donkey Man

  

Outside Sha Tu is still conversing with the kings man. He insults Splitfoot. 

Siljak talks with Donkey Man and they take some gummy drugs. The metamorphosis was successful!  Donkey turned Siljak walks out and takes a shit. This confirms to Mendel that the switch went down. Sha Tu gives the two guys some tight cube and they walk away.

  

Step Two - Pass the Gate of Goodbyes

       Ratling Slaves     Ratcatcher Golem

     Master Malcom     Reveler Mask

  

Master Macolm blows into his pitch pipe and all the slaves start singing the song of the Palace of Light and it contains all the rules and ways of the Palace. It’s a long song and kinda sucks. 

  

We have no problem getting in. As he passes through the gate, Siljak has a sense that he is being seen as the soul he is. 

  

Saito uses his Aural Corona to become super silent. Another rat says, “Hey! That one looks like your sister!” “Master says that the Ratcatcher will take these to the baths.” The ratcatcher easily picks up all three pillars and manhandles them to carry them away.

  

Step Three - Get Over the Wall

“All the lights that dance”

Mendel cocoons Sha Tu and they slide down the beam projected by Ingo. They get in with a perfect slide. Since there is a rat catcher nearby, Spider Mendel scabels up on top of the donut building, avoiding detection. 

  

They spy a slave as he draws near a pool filled with rose petals. The slave takes off his helmet. Sha Tu uses his spyglass and by watching him, transforms using the meta drug. Mendel guts him with a radula and he stumbles off to the slave warrens. Sha Tu slides down to get the helmet. He follows the blood trail. 

  

End of Session 

New location or discovery: Yes. The Palace

Did we sample and delicacies of the Vastlands?  No

Did we see / experience weird shit? Yes = Donkey Man
