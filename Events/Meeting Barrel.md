Previous Adventure: [[Events/Bone Tree]]

🐐: Paul

Why is [[Danton]] away for the evening? Taking care of the horses.

[[Grosnic]]: Is this how you remember things?

Shocked and traumatized he replies: No. There should be a town here. -- He comes off very antsy. He doesn’t know what’s up with the rocks. He doesn’t recognize shit. It’s quite different.  

Rohaus sneaks up on the Bone Picker’s camp… he fails. He pulls a classic Han Solo branch snap while maneuvering through a thicket. 

How is the Artist Colony appealing to poets?

* A ring of small structures with stage in the center surrounded by massive scrolls filled with verse. 
    
* The words/ink for the scrolls are living creatures like strings of ants. A string of them are crawling up Rohaus’ leg.
    
* He’s “buggin’ out… hehehe”. Success with consequence. He escapes but is spotted by the camp.  They holler, “You look lost…”
    
* The team heads to the Bone Picker’s camp.

The Camp is not the folks we saw on the way (with the [[Creatures/Bone Tree | Union Tree]]). There is a makeshift market here (kind of like a black market of salvage). The campers are cooking a “stone alphabet soup” out of the scrolls / letter-ants. 

There are folks here:

* A Wild looking dude with a helmet/mantle headpiece.  (see bone picker’s horde).

This is a pinkish liquid that sloshes with his movement. 

* Beside the fire is a [[Barrel | chrome barrel]] with a heat mirage radiance shimmering off it.
    
* The chief beckons us. We’ll protect you.
    

  

It’s a drizzling (not for chromatic rain) and they aren’t being touched within camp (the [[barrel]] is like a generator creating a force shield kind of deal). “You will be protected by our aegis”). 

  

There is a glass spider that emerges from a yurt and a man is riding it. There are magic vibes from this dude.

There are some dudes with pretty long beards… how do we know they’re from the Yellow City.

* They have concentric yellow rings/bands in them (some have moustaches with that). It’s a status thing, but we’re not sure what it means. It represents a level of achievement. 
    

  

Spiderman is quietly surveying things. It is a translucent shape of a spider with a violet fog roiling inside of it. 

  

Rohaus begins pitching [[wizard bone]]. 

  

[[Mendel]] asks about the wizards. He recognizes that the fella is powerful and he is impressed and wants to parl(t)ay.

  

Letters are crawling from the book on to his skin. The wizard says he doesn’t recognize [[Rohaus]], but he does recognize him, he’d much rather discuss this with him… and he points to the [[palanquin]].

  

We tell the painted man we’ll be back. He’s dubious, but he says we can come back at our leisure. 

  

* [[The Dentist]] is in the mummy phase, but his tooth situation is still growing
    

  

The Ring Unraveled. It speaks of a Yellow Grand company that has fallen apart. It was just called the Ring Divine previously.  Shoal Basta is the merchant’s name.

* He’ll buy all our shit.
* $400 for [[Creatures/Bone Tree | Union Tree]] Lumber
* The crowd perks up when the sap is mentioned. Rohaus tries to glean info from the crowd. Spider wizard says, don’t sell it. We hold off the sale of the sap.  
* We talk to some old timers and we sell our danger cutlery for $10 for info on the sap. Evidently it is a way into the [[Story Tree]] (slather yourself… fool).     
* The Merchant pats the barrel and it goes out for a moment; but it comes back
* The armor plates are rigid, but soft underneath. There is a series of dots on the side. Those dots are made from the teeth of those they kill. We trade stories for info on the sack of glands.
	- Did you pass with assistance? Joyworms. Common, for some. These glands are like joy worms… they’re taken from their victims. 
* Around the fire we’re drinking aejuice. It has a shimmer too. 
* We’re buying… or not… we get kicked because the Aegis is for paying customers only.
* Talking to the old timers:
* They’re drinking [[Vampire Wine]]. 
* They’re old and creaky, but their gear is good. They’re surprisingly relaxed. They introduce themselves as “3 Traders of Interest”
* “What happened here?”: they came here from the Harpy Brothel (blazed a trail), it ain’t what it used to be. They’re moving on soon. As best they know: there was some sort of floating rock (aerolift) (cloud made of stone) slammed into the tree. Disintegrated on contact. Tree went haywire. Sprouted hands and started tearing itself apart. That’s what ruined the area.
* “Goddamned poets.” What’s up with the artist colony. Magic ink infused their art. They got wiped out, but their magic poetry remains. 
* They ask us about us. What is your deal? [[Rohaus]] shows them the [[wizard bone]]. 
* “What do you know about [[The Dentist]]”... “You mean that dead feller you got in that box? My ghost eye saw it.” 
* The main dude has three nose holes with 2 pierced septum.
    
* Asking about the Palace of light… Good luck with that. What’s so bizarre regarding the palace. A true S’rai (sp?). It’s a sick and twisted place. 
    

* The Porcelain prince is nick named “The Gift to All Peoples”. Fad of the moment: “Becoming the most despised by their subjects.”
    
* There are only 3 real princes, but there are 97 that wear the mask and act as if… their decree is law. 
    

* The next stop is Terra Incognita:
    

* Suspersitious/SuperSonic
    
* Graveyards/Statuary Garden
    
* Petrified Cemetery
    
* It is a field of Aeroliths, connected by rope bridges (or something equally dubious).
    
* The remain static through “stuckforce”. They just hang there.
    
* These things are above a chasm (like the bridge south of here). And these floating islands are at normal level. There is a sea of energy beneath. 
    
* This is something that froze things in place… mid cataclysm. 
    
* It is the Go Low (that we saw on the sign). Which is an upside down city.
    
* It’s medium sized…. 
    

* All Blaspheme Trees are different. All they can do is hold a single word. “Union”, etc. The tree here’s word is “Dancin’”. A bunch of folks crawled out of the tree, danced, and crawled back in. Watch out. 
    
* [[Rohaus]] is heading to the wizard. The wizard is smoking from the spider’s leg. Rohaus shows Dentist teeth. 
    
* [[Mendel]] flexes and humiliates the Wizard regarding the etiquette of the teeth. He doesn’t take well to it and his humiliation manifests through his body changing colors. It starts with his eyes. Scourge of the Eastern lands… demon of nine seasons. For I am [[Gulek]].
    
* Gulek breaks out and runs away.
    
* The real Gulek gives us $250 cash and asks for [[Wizard bone]]. We sell it to him. The letters shift across the body and it shoots out his hand and flies toward Fake Gulek; his legs turn into a cloud of spiders. He falls and the spiders bite him. He screeches and screeches and goes quiet.
    
* Some of the letters return to Gulek prime and return as tattoos. He compliments us on our dry bone. We sell 2 more doses. “Spittin’ glass is associated with good bone.” $500 for 2 units of Wizard bone. 
    
* [[Mendel]] decides to take a hit off the spider (rolled a failure). The sensation is oily and coats the lungs. The others see the print of a hand pressed against the inside of the spider. Mendel is now Haunted. Fucking hell.
    

  

Session End:

* Reach a new destination: no
    
* Encounter or do weird shit: yes
    
* Grow drug empire: yes!
    

  

[[Rohaus]] needs to level. He has not officially as of session end.
