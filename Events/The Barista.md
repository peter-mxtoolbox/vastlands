üêê: [[Mendel]]

Although the paths were invisible, you could consistently find the bridges‚Ä¶ until now. As we head further away towards Grosnic‚Äôs location (to the southwest of [[Golo]] proper). This raises some questions regarding the map (and its legitimacy). 
  
[[Grosnic]]: ‚ÄúFind Silence or Die‚Äù, it is a common saying or greeting. It means may you find honor or glory. This is deep piratey shit. There is a deeper, more literal meaning. It means as a culture they need to find [[The Silence]] or they will not make it. This comes from a War long ago. She was a general (main figure) of sorts. The Pirate folk were losing and if they find her they can turn the tides. Pirates have a tradition, they would pick the most honorable of their crew and they were sent out to Find Silence or Die. They were no longer pirates, but doing the thing. They lost the war. It was against the other faction in the [[Red Lands|Red Lands]]: The Socialist collectives. 

Side note: Red land district is the pirate homeland protected by giant terracotta colossi. 

The honorable crew member is now being used to kick out the worst of your crew. Grosnic was one of these poor crew members. Every time someone gets one of these maps (to find silence) they are always very different (radically). There‚Äôs something that makes Grosnic very positive about this map‚Äôs authenticity. All of the chosen people (even the worthless ones) have gone on to become pirate captains, themselves.

[[Danton]] has been complaining about chest pains (let‚Äôs not forget his undying parasitic heart & jelly bones). He‚Äôs winded and clutching his chest. 
	q 
[[Rohaus]] has an unsettling experience with one or more of the symbiotic [[Courtesans]]. One of the courtesan‚Äôs lizard brain still has an affinity for ‚Äúfurries‚Äù and is drawn erotically to Rohaus. He is super disturbed by it and makes him really uncomfortable. This courtesan has faint whiskers. It makes faint whispering sounds but no words come out, it is the sound of stirring macaroni and cheese. She is now affectionately known as Mac & Cheese or The Mac.

We are approaching the Aerolith. It‚Äôs like there are 2 aeroliths stack on each other:
![[Aerolith.png]]

The person is for reference. It is a small thing and none of the aeroliths look like this. There is a stylized eye painted on the side.

On the side we can‚Äôt see in the image, there is a stone arch (like a tower) with steps. It looks like an entrance. 

Discern: There are several other aeroliths in the area with vegetation growing on the top. It is a shocking green hue and unlike anything else. These aeroliths are rather small (‚Öì the size). They look cultivated, they are in rows and they have a structure, not wild. This is completely out of place. They have red highlights that could be berries, flowers, the blood of the innocent.

We can find a path to the stairs. Everyone/thing but Grosnic, Siljak, Rohaus, & Mendel stay behind on the adjacent aerolith.

[[Mendel]] positions herself on the wall above the door. Her translucent body allows her to be camouflaged. 

[[Grosnic]] walks into something. He calls out ‚ÄúHello‚Äù. [[Rohaus]] tries to pull this barrier away (like it‚Äôs fabric). There is a light distorting tarp covering a four-wheeled vehicle. It‚Äôs made of synthetic wicker, like it‚Äôs grown to be in this shape. It's the same kind of car as [[Sia]], whom we met in the first episode. Grosnic checks to see if his signature is upon it (from when he fixed it). It is!

We call out ‚ÄúSia‚Äù. A person leans out from the orange gazebo. It is Sia. She‚Äôs says ‚ÄúHoly shit! I can‚Äôt believe it. You look lost‚Ä¶ still.‚Äù

![[Sia]]
  
What‚Äôs different about her?
-   She‚Äôs in pajamas, but this is not her house.

‚ÄúI never thought I‚Äôd see you‚Äôns again.‚Äù She hits this place up when she‚Äôs in the area. She's a courier and it's usually valuable stuff. She‚Äôs coy about it, but clearly this is a booty call. Who lives here?
Sia: You like coffee? Also, do you have a gift or tribute or something? 

What did she give the occupant (her):
-   A small crystal sarcophagus of syrup containing intertwined love slugs. Their copulation lasts decades producing more syrup. This syrup is quite the aphrodisiac. 
    
[[Mendel]] runs to get the [[Violet Catpiss]]. 

As we head up the staircase we can see there is a lot of history here. There is evidence of what this place was before.

-   [[Siljak]]: An outpost of some sort. There are mounts like old arrow slits. Who knows about its relationship to the era of GOLO (long before, after, etc). This place looks easy to defend.

As we reach the top, the smell of coffee comes wafting down. The stairs come up to a hatch. As we get further the tilt is very pronounced. She calls out ‚ÄúComing up, I‚Äôve got some company.‚Äù We hear the racking of the bolt of a gun. 

When we reach the top, it is a single room with pillows and loungy bits. There are only pieces of gauzy fabric separating areas. She too, is in jammies. She hastily threw some armour/helmet on to look tough. 

![[Characters/The Barista]]

What do you see around here that clue you in to the fact that this shit is from all over the world and this person is well travelled?
-   There is nose ring from beyond the mountains of the moon that‚Äôs as big as a hubcap
-   Ceremonial dagger only found amongst the 0.1% in the yellow city
-   Specialize perfume from the palace of light, key ingredient is a gland extracted from a living rabbit
-   A demon fetter (like handcuff for your feet), it‚Äôs under a desk. It's extra dimensional (supposedly). It is likely demon forged or for demon binding‚Ä¶ or both.
-   A specialized¬† Clam cracker (like nutcracker). For bronze clams. Only found in the deep sea. 
 
The Barbarista offers us coffee (in a twangy voice). She is very practiced in her movement. It is a rare and expensive item and the delivery is very ceremonial. Sia is mostly speaking for her. Rohaus is familiar with coffee, Siljak understands the whole process and is correcting people, but has no idea why. Mendel has had coffee, but it was instant and snorted. 

This is also the best coffee ever. Rohaus is convinced it is magic. Mendel enjoys it like blood going into a syringe from a spiked vein. 

There‚Äôs no one else here, but we do see movement outside one of the windows. We have a 360 view of the Golan sea. It is beautiful and peaceful, but we see a silhouette of something giant out in the sea. Smaller than a leviathan, but still huge.

![[Coffee Dragon.png]]

It stares at us. It is drinking coffee and takes a sip. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about that, its just an illusion.‚Äù it responds with a scoff. 

[[Grosnic]] offers the gift of the cat piss to The Barbarista. The carboy is furry, because it is actually the cat‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs horrifying. This cat has no tail, but does have hands. The cat is kind of violet. Barbarista is suspicious and uses a black light otoscope and the cat's body shows a crazy pattern like a tabby or ocelot coloring. She freaks out because this is authentic.

She runs her finger down the abdomen of the cat and finds the right spot and adrenaline shots it. This violet inky liquid comes out and she extracts the piss into some fancy cups that appear to be made for this purpose. 

She delivers a toast in a foreign tongue. But we know the sounds of the words. She throws her head back at the end and starts laughing. We all get the ceremony.¬† We shoot.

-   Mendel, Rohaus: Success
-   Grosnic: Success with Consequences
-   Siljak: Failure

You have to drink the whole cat‚Ä¶ a drinking contest of sorts. [[Siljak]] fails and is out. The coffee, catpiss combo is too much. [[Characters/The Barista]] smiles, thats when we realize, this shit stains your teeth purple. [[Grosnic]] is struggling, but he feels the need to impress and that he is being evaluated. This is a very alcoholic kind of high. We all just chilling and talking.

Rohaus and Mendel are here to help Grosnic get to where he needs to be. Grosnic is drunk and Rohaus is jumping in. he is inquiring about the specialness of this place. [[Rohaus|Rohaus's]] tattoo changes. It is a terribly specific insult that is different for anyone who reads it. 

Barbarista is a nomad from the West. She is a Good Gun nomad. The insult is: Pacifist Homesteader. She looks angry for a tense moment, then she just howls with laughter. Rohaus asks if this place is still Brohm. Barbarista drops her cup and it shatters on the table. ‚ÄúWhat did you just say?‚Äù She leans into Grosnic very pointedly. Grosnic responds, ‚ÄúFind Silence or die.‚Äù 

She almost collapses back onto her pillow. She‚Äôs shocked and there is an emotional weight that has lifted. Sia has no idea what is occurring. The Barbarista puts her hand on her chest and says, ‚ÄúI am Brohm. You have a map?‚Äù Grosnic hands her the map and she takes it. She regards it and there is silence. The silence is broken when we hear the sound of her tears hitting the map. She runs her hand over the map. She is very emotional and wants to know where this came from. Grosnic explains, albeit drunkenly. He still believes in her and what Silence represents.

Barbarista explains that she is very old and has lived many lifetimes. She knew the Silence, she uses a word that is old school that implies they were intimate. She travelled East with the Silence until they reached her. She told her to stay here and she was going to claim the ship that was rightfully hers. She speaks of her as being a very powerful wizard. She warded the place to protect it, but it also made Barb age slower. This place is deteriorating. The aerolith and immediate surroundings are all that are left of the Silence. This is her legacy. This map with its writing is the only thing that Barb has of Silence. Her handwriting. When Silence left her here, she left something else with her. It was the key to the ship (so to speak). It was her token to get on the ship. Barb has this token on a leather thong around her neck. Grosnic trades the map for the token (this key). It is a compass. Not a regular one though. It is a heart that beats that lets you know where to go. It is made of stone. It is beautiful. She hands it to Grosnic. When it goes into his hand it is a transference of power or something. It shudders and comes back to regularity. Grosnic feels it. 

![[The Yellow Wastes.png]]

Before we leave the [[aerolith]]‚Ä¶

-   Does [[Sia]] want to join? Yes. She is bringing sacks of coffee to sell at GOLO.
	-   Coffee is what‚Äôs being grown off the rocks. It‚Äôs called Crooked Eye Coffee
-   That [[Coffee Dragon.png|coffee dragon]] is still there. It is real.
-   Nothing past Cloudhenge is good for grazing for animal stock
-   [[Golo]] is down on the living dead. So the Palaquin/Dentist is going to cause problems. They have banned necromancy. There was a huge plague that swept the Yellow Wastes that didn‚Äôt get any further than here. It was a necro ambulist wave (old skool Walking Dead zombie style)
-   Shall we harvest the Dentist? 
	-   We use the brass clam cracker to separate the wizard bone. 
	-   Break down the skeleton; jazz the bones; test for potency.
	-   [[Grosnic]]: chops it the fuck up. It was complicated initially with the cracker.
	-   [[Mendel]]: pulp some of the wizard bone.
	-   [[Siljak]]: sensory deprivation tablet. 
	-   15 wizard bone out of the Dentist
-   We render the Last Story Tree wizard
	-   When Rohaus opens the backpack, the undead wizard is active. It‚Äôs arms and legs are reversed. It's very upsetting. 
	-   [[Rohaus]] Sweeps the legs (arms) to pacify this sucka.
	-   [[Grosnic]]: He loses some of the bone because some of the bones just bug out.
	-   [[Mendel]]: Lose some more to mush.
	-   [[Siljak]]: He notices that a few are just balls. They have a sharp acrid ammonia quality. That hand foot was weird.    
	-   14 more doses.
-   Holy cow!
    
-   [[Gulek]] and [[Barol]] are good friends... That‚Äôs not so good. He wants to be a meangirl, but has no follow through.
  
End of session:
-   New discovery? Yes.
-   New shit? Yes.
-   Grow Drug Empire? Yes!
    
Grosnic has hit Lev. 5. So he should level.
