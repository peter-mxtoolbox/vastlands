🐐: Brad / #58263 (Ken)

It’s been about a week since the rest of the team left. [[Sha tu|Scab]] is getting concerned, so he heads out on his own to find everyone. He reaches the Jelly-rendezvous and the points of light begin to descend. He sees the glowing skulls and he guides them in. The Jellies descend and spit out the skulls as they did with the other group and he dons the Jelly and walks into the desert. The Jelly “helmet” allows him to see footprints as a path to the location.

[[Jelly Life]] is best life part 2: 
-   Jelly is verile. They are a dominant species.   

[[Sha tu|Scab]] is skeptical at first, but likes what they have to say and wants to broaden their horizons  and uses `Maximum Discourse` to convince them his Life is also Life. The Jellies are shaken to their core by this notion. They crowd together and their color shifts wildly as they palaver. The Jelly respond that they have much to ponder and that they will return to give him their response. Then they float away.

[[Sha tu|Scab]] has arrived at the lip of the crater and sees [[T@B1TH@]] chilling out minding its own business. In the distance, in the middle of the bog, he sees his friends fiddling with the door. Just as he is going to greet them, the doors pop open and he sees the team getting swept away. He tries to cover the distance but must travel through the muck and haze (and risk inebriation). `F! Strain S!` He ends up with a pleasant buzz and isn't negatively affected.

Everyone goes beneath the stream of slime for a moment and stumbles through the doors. As we rise up from the goo we see a chandelier above us. The interior of the dome has a high ceiling and is ~50 yards across. There is a perimeter walkway with the remnants of a railing around a sunken interior that is a step down from the perimeter platform. The interior of the dome is appointed and decorated with furniture and artwork, implying someone lives here. The chandelier is still lit and the accuramounts appear curated. However, the slime is still coming through the door, ruining it all.

[[58263|Ken]] climbs to higher ground. He reaches a 6’ wide platform in the center of the room at bar height that is covered in a tasseled tapestry with a motif of skulls and onions. 

[[Idsovak]] sees a pedestal near the door also covered in a tapestry which appears to be acting as a stand for a big glowing black bowl (3’ across). It is made of volcanic glass and emanates a blue glow. There is a humming noise coming from the pedestal. Upon closer inspection, [[Idsovak]] finds a control panel on the pedestal beneath the tapestry. She pushes a blinking button. 

Meanwhile, [[Nopal]] runs to the open door and attempts to push it shut, to no avail. He decides to summon up more strength from within, there is a shower of sparks coming from the panel where [[Idsovak]] pushed the button. The doors shut. [[Nopal]] feels like he’s the one that shut the door… he knew he had it in him. [[Sha tu|Scab]] slides through just as the doors shut. 

[[58263|Ken]] finds some very tall hieroglyphics and investigates. `F!` He doesn’t understand them, but he is drunk and it’s causing him to be very anxious about what they mean. He thinks it is a warning about poison. He shouts: “Hold your breath!”

[[Idsovak]] is looking around for a drain of some kind. `F! Strain still F!` She is too drunk and gets distracted by a sculpture of an antlered lizard head made from liquid mercury which is slowly dripping upward. Hanging from its antlers are a bunch of talismans and necklaces with unique symbols–many are broken, bent, or damaged in some way. Through her study of the [[Veda of the Abmortal Doctor]] she recognizes some as nomadic totems and thinks that they are all holy symbols from various faiths and sects. 

As she approaches the tip of her shoe catches in a seam that bisects the whole of the room. She falls face first into the slime.

[[Nopal]] lifts [[Lorde]] and shows it to the room. “What speaks to you?” he asks it. As he moves it around, one of its spines pokes his finger when it is facing the pedestal with the volcanic bowl. He takes this as a sign and approaches. `S!` Upon closer inspection, the bowl is carved to look like ash serpents from the [[Spirit Forge]] knotted together. The blue glow is from beneath a shimmering blue liquid within. [[Nopal]] reaches in, when his hand breaches the water the familiar scent of blood wafts from it. He pulls one of the many glowing pieces to find it is a thumb sized diamond, that is sweating blood. [[Nopal]] offers [[Lorde]] the diamond and Lorde suckles on it like a pacifier. [[58263|Ken]] warns against it, still thinking of poison, but Nopal allows Lorde to continue and he grabs a few more gems `5 blood diamonds gems added to his inventory`.

[[Sha tu|Scab]] joins [[Nopal]] and discreetly pushes the other button on the control panel on the pedestal. There is a whirring sound followed by a booming voice above. It imperiously shouts “What is the meaning of this?” A blue hairless face appears through the wall scowling at us. “Did the supreme hair leviathan put you up to this?” (His voice is like Nandor The Relentless). The whirring becomes louder as machinery beneath the floor comes to life and the seam begins to part. Slime and furniture fall into the floor as a chasm is revealed. The face says “Holy shit!” and backs out of the room.   

[[58263|Ken]] position in the center of the room doesn’t move as the floor parts around him. [[Sha tu|Scab]] and Nopal’s positions near the control panel are still on the platform. Only the sunken portion of the floor is moving. [[Idsovak]] is in the danger zone, but once she notices Scab pushing the button she runs for cover. `S! (max)`. She cartwheels into a handspring and vaults over the railing to safety. This was possible due to her inhibition disappearing from drunkenness. Nopal sheepishly puts some of the diamonds back. 

The face materializes in full through the wall levitating above the floor.

“You better put those back… don’t think I didn’t see.” It says to [[Nopal]]. The figure quickly realizes everything is falling and frantically shouts, “Save the here! Save the hear!” No one can really understand its accent, but it is gesturing toward an elaborate rack covered in what looks like braided rope. It is long braids of hair woven into various arts and crafts projects like dream catchers and gods-eyes.  

[[Idsovak]] and [[Nopal]] are closest to the hair sculpture and try to save it. [[Idsovak]] pulls one of her animal snares and unleashes it to try to grab the rack as it falls. `F! Strain C!` She snares the hair rack just in time but can’t keep a grip on it and [[Nopal]] lunges out past the railing to grab it. `C!` He is able to get the hair out of harm’s way, but a beautiful NetherGo set falls into the hole. (The game is in its final stages, [[Sha tu|Scab]] shouts “White gets mate in 3!”). There is a silence as the set falls in, then there is an answering shriek that answers from below. A chorus of high pitched screeching noise, like metal being strained. The Blue Figure’s eyes go wide. “Do you know what you’ve done?!” It floats down, very slowly, to retrieve the hair. 

[[Sha tu|Scab]] awkwardly offers his NetherGo set as a replacement and asks, “What is down there?” It replies, “Let’s just say it’s something I told I would let out if they gave me enough diamonds.” It pauses, “I lied. Are you familiar with [[Purple Machine Ghouls]]? There are hundreds of them down there. Now they are coming up here to get their revenge and devour the world.” Scab is furiously pushing the buttons to close the floor. The outer door opens. 

[[Idsovak]] whistles for [[T@B1TH@]], it comes and waits at the door.

Everyone can’t help but peek into the pit. Inside is a long spiral ramp along the walls of the chasm. There is a constellation of yellow dots (eyes) at the bottom of the hole. [[Idsovak]] grabs the rack with the holy symbols (turns out it’s a mask) and heads out. Everyone follows suit until they realize [[58263|Ken]] is still in his position in the center of the hole. He’s about to do an Erol Flynn-esc chandelier swing when [[Sha tu|Scab]] tosses him his emergency ornithopter. `F! (max)`. The heavy backpack knocks Ken right off his position. He grabs a corner of the tapestry on the way down revealing the "platform" is a floating coffin. His grab allows him to lurch to one side and land on the ramp. Covered in slime, the ramp is now a slip-n-slide and Ken barrels down towards the bottom.

The [[Purple Machine Ghouls]].   

As he is headed toward the ghouls, [[58263|Ken]] tries to commune with the Jelly inside him. **Jelly does not hunger for conflict**, so he will merge with the slime to wait the situation out. `F! Strain C!` Instead of fading into the slime he slams directly into a Ghoul. He takes `5 damage`, but encases the machine ghoul and is in control of it and leverages this new found situation to travel up the ramp. The Ghoul resists, so Ken is trying to convince it that Jelly-Life is best life. 

After the coffin is revealed, the Blue Figure whistles and the coffin floats across the gap. He mounts it and rides it. Everyone else is outside trying to figure out what to do about [[58263|Ken]] when he runs out encasing the Ghoul. People start pulling weapons but Ken is quick to use his Jelly-Nature to make an image of his helmeted head above the Ghoul indicating he is in control.

He is now the Ken Ghoul. That is Kenny Ghoul. That is Kenny G.

[[Idsovak]] is incredibly intrigued by Jelly Life controlling the ghoul. This is very much in line with the [[Veda of the Abmortal Doctor]]. 

The party returns to find [[Margrave Purpureo|Margrave]] & [[Psu]] (who are still drunk). The Blue Figure introduces himself as [[Demorzanno]] and is a vampire and Other Land Blood Diamond broker. He admits he had been trading hair to the Ghouls for [[blood diamonds]] and promised to somehow get them out. They are obsessed with hair, because there is nothing like it down in the machine pit. They even took to calling the outside “Hair World”; This is also why he’s hairless. Demorzanno says the worst thing about being a vampire is being dependent on the blood of the living. The [[blood diamonds]] are the solution, a never ending source of food for vampires. "We will be rich! Once we get back out of the Oasis and find some vampires."

[[58263|Kenny G]] needs to get back to the [[Machine Pit]] and get his gear (especially his letter). 

[[Sha tu|Scab]] is a bit of a Messianic figure for the Jelly. He could convince the Jelly to take over the Ghouls, like Ken did.

We head to the Jelly landing area and there are hundreds of Jelly lights descending on our position. Then there is one massive light descending. A UFO sized Jelly. The whole Jelly populace is coming down to witness the interaction with Scab after he’s blown their mind.

End of session:

Did we deepen interpersonal relationships with Sparks?
-   No one

Discover a new place:
-   Yes… Machine Ghoul Pit

Meaningfully advance personal quest:
*   Nopal - feeding Lorde
-   Idsovak - didn’t advance, but the Jelly-Life connection is a good jumping off point for more things.

Ken is scheduled to Level.
