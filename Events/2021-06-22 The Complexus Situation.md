#### Foraging
[[Grosnik]]: He goes to the [[Story Tree]] and sees some buds growing. He’s checking out stone fruits. He gets two stone fruits. A third one falls and cracks open. It’s like an apple inside with white flesh and seeds. He also spies a [carboy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboy) of [[violet catpiss]]

[[Siljak]]: He is looking around the bonepickers camp to see if any campers left behind supplies. He finds a barrel of yogurt. [[Barol]] gives him a pithy remark. He sees an airship in the distance coming nearer.

[[Rohaus]]: Is looking for dried meats in the Artists Colony. He finds no food. Letters from poetry lost attack him. He takes 5 damage. They become a tattoo on his forehead. 

[[Danton]]: He sees some hexagonal canisters with land coral. He puts on his [[bodysnatcher burka]]. He finds three canisters of “biomass”. He sees the nomad ship fly very near. They are sure to be here imminently. 

[[Spider Mendel]]: He comes face to face with an out of control burden beast. He takes a debility of hazy. 

With the last airbender drawing near, we beat feet and head toward [[Golo]].

#### Leave for GOLO

We see the bright light in the sky in the distance. When we get to the edge we see the sea of pink energy.  Our hairs stand on edge. There is a pervasive sound of the energy, the “cracklin’s” that some travelers have for years after hearing the sound. [[Grosnic|Grosnic's]] map shows lines extending from each of the larger “islands”.

[[Siljak]] takes note of small magnetic bushes. We eat half-rations. [[Mendel]] plays a mini-game to fish teeth out of [[the dentist]].

Aerolith erosion: shining phishers form in the rock and a beast falls into a fissure. [[BBQ]] falls into the fissure. [[Grosnic]] shield slams him and saves him, but now BBQ hates him. 

Encounter: We come upon a giant skull / helmet (barn sized) in the wilderness. We see glamourous robed figures coming out of the structure. Many of them. They strut and prance. A booming amplified alarmed voice says, “No! Come back!” Shimmering bolts of color come down from the sky.

These snakes shoot from the sky. They sidewind to the figures and strike at them repeatedly. A wheeled mechanism appears in the mouth of the helmet/skull. It has a bubble on the top filled with fluid and something that looks like brains. “Noooooo!”

[[Spider Mendel]] rushes up to talk with the wheeled mechanism. The tank is filled with fake brains and cat eyes. “Please save the children! Save them!”

[[Grosnic]] attacks a snake with his axe.

[[Rohaus]] goes over to [[Barol]] and eventually gets the forcefield turned on. 

[[Danton]] approaches an attached snake and brandishes snake oil. The nearly dead snake strikes [[Y.A.M.S.]]. on the nose. 

[[Siljak]] shoots a lone snake but his rifle jams afterwards

Y.A.M.S. decapitates a courtesan accidentally and a thick honey-like liquid comes out.

In the final minutes we slay the rest of the snakes, one of the other courtesans is attached to [[Barol]]. 

[[Danton]] realizes that the courtesans are symbiotes. They instantly die in the atmosphere. 

It appears that the courtesan was at one time a normal human, but it’s nervous system has been replaced with vomish wiring. To make it a host for the symbiote. 

The mech wheels up and starts harvesting the wires from the dead courtesan. 

![[Pussy Complexus.png]]
[[Pussy Complexus|Jaeger]] - Philosopher-pimp: a wheeled jar of ceramic cat brains. 

Siljak uses a spell detonator to shrink down the [[Cheese Helmet|helmet]] to normal size. It is associated with generation. It can grow cheese inside that the wearer can eat. “Help me Cheesus!”
