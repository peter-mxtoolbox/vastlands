Loose Ends

What happens to the revelors?

-   They live out with their memories and do better
    
-   They are all taken over by the ratling spirits
    

  

What happens to the dead ratling spirits?

-   They continue to haunt the grounds, unable to escape
    
-   They burst forth into the yellow wastes, angry
    
-   They possess the revelors bodies, the ghosts can live again within the palace walls
    

  

Palace of Light wiki

There was a period of time where there were slaves of all types. During Siljacks time as Master Malcolm there was a change in plans. They decided to go with ratlings 100%. They suffered more because their spirits are tied to where they die. Siljack left. The ringleaders bring in Agatha and lock her away.

The ratling “Smarter” found the spellbook and educated himself as to the magic used to contain Agatha. … 

The three porcelain princes were the ratcatchers. They lost their minds and became mindless automatons. 

So a group of rats decided to take their revenge with the ruse that the palace became. They setup all the illusions and bring in these horrible people and torture them there by plugging them in.

King Abrasion

  

What happens when King Abrasion and his goons rush the gates?

-   ⭐ They sack the place taking anything of value they can find
    
-   They try to seize the palace for themselves. There is bloody fighting but they are repelled
    
-   They don’t rush the gates, but raid the rest of the settlements.
