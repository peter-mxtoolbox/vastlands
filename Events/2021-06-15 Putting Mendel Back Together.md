Previous Adventure: [[2021-06-08 Into the Story Tree]]

June 15, 2021

üêê: [[Siljak]]

[[Danton]] lost track of time tending to [[Y.A.M.S.]] and realized everybody else was gone. [[Horse Lord]] Unlocked. They go over to investigate the Dream Well. The chain just goes down into the darkness. He tosses a coin into the well. It hits something metal and then it sounds like it hits earth. He calls down to the well, ‚ÄúHello‚Äù. He winches up the chain to see what is on the end of it. He attempts to climb down the chain but he falls and hurts himself. The bottom of the well opens up in an erlenmeyer flask shape. There is a body down here. It‚Äôs relatively fresh. It‚Äôs wearing a [[Bodysnatcher Burka]] which he takes. The burka protects the wearer's identity, protects the wearer from splashes, and makes the wearer hard to see to the undead.

Inside a pocket inside the burka, there is a document and it is fancy. It is a deed to a pair of slaves named Smart and Smarter who are located in the [[Palace of Light]]. 

The gang shows [[Danton]] some of the vomish material they harvested from the tentacles that had invaded the [[Story Tree]].

We go talk to Gulek Prime to see if he might be willing to help us try to get the soul into the glass spider. He asks us about what happened inside the tree. He wants one thing. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have a lot of time. Take me into the tree to where the heart was. The tree tried to protect the high storyteller. It has absorbed him, I must take his place.‚Äù

The plan to transfer here is as follows.
-   Try to cleanse the spider from anything that‚Äôs currently in it
-   Pray over the stone to loosen up the souls
-   Punch the souls out of the stone
-   [[Mendel]] tries to be dominant over the other souls

[[Siljak]] puts his staff down and commands the spirits within the spider to get out. They go to the back of the spider.

[[Danton]] takes off his hat, lays his [[Gemmed Beetles]] on the ground. He lays his hands on two beetles and his head on the third prostrating himself. He murmurs prayers that levitate the stone and make it glow.

[[Rohaus]] jumps up, claps his hands, and does a double air rabbit drop kick on the stone.

The two souls that we concentrated on, split into four. All four souls went into the spider.

[[Spider Mendel]] comes to and seems like nothing has happened. More is better than fewer.

#### Aegis Barrel Disapproval Parent

We bring [[Gulek]] into the tree. Rohaus gets caught in some of the tentacles at the beginning. We see stone galls inside the story tree.t

They begin to form giant creatures. [[Spider Mendel]] pushes them back with his eight arms.

In the vestibule we see the wall start to bulge. He hands a liquid filled bladder to [[Danton]] and directs him to spray the bulge. Danton puts the bladder under his arm to create pressure. He takes the cris that Gulek gave him and punctures a small hole and sprays the wall. The stone hardens and then cracks. Under the stone is flesh. Gulek slashes open the flesh. He pulls out bones and they fall on the ground. The bones start to arrange themselves. 
  
Gulek climbs into the nasty puss filled wound. He hands another bladder to Siljak and says, ‚ÄúSeal me in!‚Äù

[[Siljak]] does his best. It doesn‚Äôt work 100%. The tree collapses in around him like a vertical mouth and chews him up. 

As we leave the tree, we turn around and see that the tree is now covered in raised characters like [[Gulek]].
