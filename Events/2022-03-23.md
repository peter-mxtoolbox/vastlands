Goat: Spider Mendel / Paul

  

The bath house is inside the palace proper having been carried in by the ratcatcher. We catch a sign that says “Orgy Pools”. All sorts of nasty things are going on out there. We notice the door has glowing runes on it. The door itself seems flimsy, but there is something about these runes that seems warding. It smells of steak. They appear similar to the glyphs on Malcolm’s headwear. Rasklana’s dick pillar gets carried into the door. Garland gets carried in next.  Saito sneaks out of his pillar before being carried in. He hides in an alcove. 

  

After delivering the pillars, he seals the door to the pools. Up till now it has been eerily quiet. After the door is closed, the ratcatcher starts emanating a cacophony of party noise as he walks away down the hall. 

  

Garland and Rasklana get out. They see a mask or head or something floating in the pool. All across the top of the room is a bas relief art sculpture that shows an oroboros penis.

The penis of the pool

  

Something rises up out of the pool. The sound it makes… The smell… 

  

Garland tries hitting the door to get Saito’s attention. However all he can hear is a wet rhythmic slapping sound. The creature attacks. It knocks Rasklana down and then shoots gripping mechanisms at her. She is being dragged into the pool. She tries to fight back, but it starts to pull her apart. Saito realizes that the situation has changed. He takes out his cube which is in its very small configuration. He places it under the door and then causes it to grow which destroys the door. We both can see Rasklana being pulled into the beast.

Garland shoots a rocket at the beast and it goes into the maw that was about to ensnare her. It causes it to drop Rasklana and she is able to get away. As the orifice closes, the rocket explodes and goop goes everywhere. Garland picks up the mask and throws it on. 

  

Siljak is in a small crawlspace that the slaves use to restock the shelves. Inside there is an impossibly large book on a stone pedestal. It is connected to the stand with a chain. Master Malcom is looking at this book. Something drops from the rafters and as it comes into view Siljak can see:

Squat Assassin

  

Malcom says, “That was fast.”

“Yes, I was surprised. I found him outside crawling around like an animal outside of town.”

“Is that what I asked for?”

The dude empties the bag he has and Siljak’s head falls to the ground. 

The head starts to change and Siljak feels like he has to do something. He kicks some books off the shelf, and runs out. He kicks the shit out of the head and splits apart when it hits a hand candle thing making it unrecognizable. He runs away down the hall and gets out to the courtyard.

  

Sha Tu grabs a few pieces of parchment which are poking up from the grate the slave had collapsed on. He drags the body by the ankle out to the courtyard. Sha Tu finds a heavy medallion that the slave had under its robes. Spun platinum with emeralds. They also had a parchment and a stylus on their person. The parchment has a poem on it:

  

I am struck

By the lightning

Of seeing you

After you are gone

  

Siljak, Mendel, and Sha Tu meet up near the tree of tears pointed out before we started the heist. Siljak gets closer to inspect the tree, knowing much about them. His hand passes through the tree and he realizes the tree is an illusion. ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/DioskCcS2gJ3iINB2fXwZU31jeFJaFwvAsW2k_Nd9GhtA4p207AEeLZ2Srkip8fPcOltcsRsxMTp6Z6NG_r909q1lnvS_IMhAc2y7KUQbj49wglO1wx8Yrpxh7xBSzcePDc-zd6pW6vexZhjsA)

Sha Tu looks at the tree with his articulated eye. He senses the Veda of Seeming Becoming. He senses not only deception, but also some emotion of love or lost. 

  

Garland’s soul feels heavy from the weight of the mask he put on. He cannot shake a feeling of longing to connect.
