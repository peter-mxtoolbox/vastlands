[[Sha Tu]] uses his telescope to check things out and sees a figure with a flat hat and carrying large hollow spheres? He walks from the Cat Fancies to the Degenerate Sigil Shack.

[[58263|JennyG]] heads over the [[_Valley of the Cats#Cat's Crater|Cat's Crater]] to ask the [[Worm of the Sixty Winters]] about the man at the Sigil Shack. He sees a [[Shadow Tourist]]. He asks about the fellow. The Worm says he takes the old gourds after they are consumed to be juiced. 

“You need to be careful about that guy, or you’ll end up like that last caravan that went pokin’ around over there.

[[Nopal]] goes over to talk to the [[Worm]] since he is a Beastmaster. It brushes up against him and purrs similar to what happened when [[Catriarch]] let us in. Eventually they converse and the worm tells Nopal that the vibrations are not good here and soon it will have to leave. Nopal tells it that there is a giant monster headed here. 

[[Mongag]] wants to pet a cat. It begins to get dusky and night approaches. Something is skittering around down there. It’s some type of robot looking creature with a cat riding on top of it. Mongag tries to lure the robot + cat combo over. The cat does not like this. The robot starts making a whine noise that keeps getting louder and higher in pitch. [[Mongag]] tries again to calm the cat. This does NOT work. The robot unleashes an earthquake. [[Dogcutter]] tips over. This is a skyscraper sized sword. People come from all around to climb it and commune with a spirit that is rumored to live in the pommel. Well they used to until it fell over. 

It falls near [[Pspspsps House]] and while not destroying it, it breaks open the seal on the gate there. Swarms of [[Chatter Bats]] come out.

[[Mongag]] commands the [[Gnosis Bat]] to calm the [[Chatter Bats]]. It flies into the swarm and chills them out.

[[Nopal]] goes to tell [[The Worm]] that we are going into the gate and if we aren’t back after a while, we might need some help. We invite [[Demorzano]] to come with us into the vampire nest. 

  

We start suiting up for our adventure. We see [[Possum Knight]] packing up their gear.  He says he’s leaving. There are shadow tourists here. He explains how they only appear right before horrible disasters. He’s out. 

We climb / shimmy up [[Dogcutter]] towards the top of the head and the gate. 

[[Mongag]] climbs up to the pommel to talk to the spirit. It shares secret knowledge with anyone who dares climb it. The spirit, named Call of the Void, challenges [[Mongag]] to a game of wits. Mongag asks about the path of vengeance, whatever possessed me in my youth. The Doom Farmers. They plant seeds in vulnerable minds, they let them gestate and germinate, and then they harvest the psychic energy released in the violent actions. They use this to fertilize these giant eggs floating over the farm. They really aren’t so bad actually. 

  

 [[Mongag]] gets tossed off, but lands on his feet. [[Dogcutter#Call of the Void|Call of the Void]] says as he leaves, “you might be a dad.”

[[58263|JennyG]] mentions that she knows about [[Doom Farms]]. [[Demorzano]] tells us about [[Supreme Terror Leviathan]], banished to the [[Black Oasis]]. He’s an asshole.

We see the [[Degenerate Sigil]] gourd carrier. The chasm next to the shack is trapped in a geometric sigil. [[Mongag]] wants to engage him to get a boon as he is out of gas. He sees skins outside the shack on poles. 

Mongag gets licked as he knocks on the wall to the shack. He knows nothing of Lizard People and just blurts out that he needs a sigil for his upcoming fight. He agrees to give Mongag a sigil that fills his strain in exchange for holding the staff of the gnosis bat. Mongag also got to see inside the shack and saw stacks of sarcophagi.
