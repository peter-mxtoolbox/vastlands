[[_Valley of the Cats]]
-   [[Worm of the Sixty Winters]]
-   Cenotaph of the Tenth Life
-   Pspspsps House
-   Dogcutter
-   The Grit
-   Cat Fancies
-   Degenerate Sigil Shack - home of [[Degenerate Sigil]]
-   Vampire Nest Entrance
 

Where was [[Characters/God-to-Be]] all this time? [[Nopal]] took him out originally under his hat. Back at the [[Palace of Light]] he had gotten a box that needles had come in. You have to tickle it to make it open. Nopal checks on him. He’s okay but a little cramped in there. 

  

The [[Characters/God-to-Be]] is not super pleased about not being worshiped lately. You need to announce my arrival when we arrive at locations.  

  

We learn that when we remove the [[Psychopomp's Seal]] we are not sure how large the [[Characters/God-to-Be]] will end up becoming.

  

The wind blows through the Stray Titan which makes up the central area of [[The Valley of the Cats]]. [[Catriarch]] is upset when he sees the state of the Cenotaph. The monument looks new, despite being in disarray now. It was fine just a short time ago when the [[Catriarch]] was last here. 

  

Dedicated to the brave cats who gave their nine lives against the elf touched.

May they live again forever in our memory.

  

We can see that in and among the rubble that people had left offerings. [[JennyG]] attempts to look at the rubble to see what might have happened. Recent geologic activity caused this. Jenny can perceive a thrumming vibration which was the cause. She finds a complete set of Rideryear Skin Figurines - worth $6k.

  

We decide to head up to the [[Worm of the Sixty Winters]]. We leave the party beast behind as it is not comfortable with the worm. [[Possum Knight]] joins us. [[Catriarch]] goes down on all fours and rubs his head up against the worm and purrs. The worm purrs back and opens up a passageway for us to pass through.

“Well god damned! It took you long enough!,” says the dude who introduces himself as the Worm.  [[Possum Knight]] knows this guy. He asks who is the glemfx and PK points out [[Nopal]]. He throws some jacks (used as currency here) to PK who says to Nopal, “Good luck.”

            Cat Bag Maker The Cat’s Eye

  

Ethical cat juicer is making cat bags. [[Mongag]] wants to talk with him. [[Nopal]] and [[Idsovak]] follow Worm of Sixty Winters, [[Sha Tu]] and [[JennyG]] go with catriarch to his house.

  

[[Mongag]] asks Ostrander for advice and goes to talk with the artist. He compliments him on his work and says he could never make such art. [[Mongag]] learns his ways to make cat bags and leaves the hutch having purchased a starter kit because he wants to try his hand at making his own. 

  

Up at the Catriarch’s house - it is a prefabricated building made by Cogflower. He shows off the [[Cat’s Eye]]. It once gazed out from the Stray Titan. If you look into the eye you can see remote locations. [[JennyG]] looks back to [[_Thousand Fingers]]. The dwellers there band together to fight the [[KaiGool]]. They gather slime whistles from the [[Shoppe of Exiles]] and it destroys [[The Rock of Exiles]]. Next it goes over to the [[Characters/God-to-Be]] pillar and devours all the treasure left up there. It then tears down the pillar. The Night Mouth Clanhold attacks with ranged weapons. The KaiGool has a breath weapon, a cloud of nanites. A purple, glittery dust cloud. It dissolves inorganic matter. The navy made up from water taxis under the leadership of [[The Slamm]] attacked and pushed the  [[KaiGool]] away and east. Thousand Fingers is now known as [[Broken Fingers]]. 

  

At the Pspspsps House [[Catriarch]] tells [[Sha Tu]] the story of the Stray Titan. [2:06] They sacrificed their cathood to defeat the elf touched. They are now just cats. 

  

Something doesn’t add up about the [[Catriarch]] story. [[JennyG]] is curious about the Catriarch itself and asks about its origin. “Well, it’s complicated. I don’t hail from the Violet City. I took a different path to get here.” “I have elected not to have a familiar as these cats do not either.” Jenny can feel the vibrations coming up through her feet. 

  

[[Sha Tu]] asks if that humming has always been here. “The wind?”

  

[[Nopal]] and [[Idsovak]] are talking with Big Worm in a DIY bar they have set up. There is a sign that reads, “Cats Crater”. Big Worms says he is a “partial Inn Keeper, Bar Keeper, Peace Keeper, Grounds Keeper, Vampire Hunter and… a fixer of sorts.” “But you wouldn’t know anything about that?”

  

He points out four places that have to do with Golums. “That’s the Steel Flea, a tank out in the desert.” Next is a dashed line on the map, “This is the patrol route of what we call “The Old Guard” which is a war frame that fought in this battle for the cats. Last thing is “The hell hole. If you want flavor crystals, that’s where we go.”  
  

New Location: Negative

Increase Family Bonds: yes all players (possum knight, catriarch) 

Meaningful progress on personal goal: Mongag, Nopal, Sha Tu

Paul's Notes
2022-08-02

G: Scab

  

The party arrives at the [[_Valley of the Cats]].  During our journey, G2B was travelling with us ostensibly to go to the holy mountain. He's been stored in the ticklebox that Nopal's dancing needles were stored in. No one really heard from him last time so Nopal goes to check on him in the box. `3` The G2B is a little cramped inside, but he's okay. Nopal apologizes, but let's him know that he's cool, he's made to suffer. The G2B is concerned about being worshiped. Nopal is now his herald and he must announce his arrival to this new place. 

  

There is a complication with the seal. When the seal is removed we roll to determine the size of the G2B. 

  

There are haunting tones as the wind blows through it. Centrally is the Stray Titan. There are cats about. The entire place is lonely and sparsely populated. Just smoke coming from some homes at the Worm or from the Pspsps house. The Catriarch is upset at the state of the Cenotaph... it was not broken when he left a few weeks ago. 

  

The contruction on the Cenotaph makes it look very new. It is a war memorial with an engraved marker. In 6 diff lanugages,  "dedicated to the brave cats that gave their nine live to defend against the elf touched, may they live again forever in our memory. " A crevasse has opened swallowing this up. There were offering around it in the rubble. 

  

Idsovak investigates the chasm, it is not sentient. Jenny G sizes up the sitch. `S!` This is recent geologic activity. Jenny G just hops in and relizes his sense of touch is incredibly heightened. He can perceive a humming vibration through the rock. Whatever caused the vibration caused this. Jenny G mentioned this to the Catriarch. It requests all the valuables. He finds a complete set of Rider Year skin figurines. They represent the "Year of the Rider" where there was a random collection of "riders" that showed up throughout the world. Since they're skin figurines they are made of skin and are pliant. Its a part of the skin trade and they are made from Skin-tern types out of skin molds. They need to be treated with lotion and whatnot. 

  

`Skin figures worth $6k`

  

The Worm of Sixty Winters takes care of everything while the Catriarch is gone. "I've known him for years, he's great". Sixty Winters is the worm's name. He came from the Red Lands. The PB is a bit hesitant to get close to the Worm. It is quietly writhing. 

  

We leave and take Possum Knight with us. The Possum needs a drink. The Catriarch gets down on all fours and purrs and rubs up against the worm and it uncoils and lets us in. The worm purrs back (a low rumble). A spiked valley to walk through to get to the center. It is clearly defending the area. 

  

We meet this cybernetic old man with a giant weapon staff. He says "Well Goddamn! took you long enough." "Hello Worm". The Possum knows this guy. He is the Worm of Sixty Winters. He asks which one of these is the Golem Guy? The Possum Kinight points to Nopal. This guy. Nopal is very excited and he pulls out the box and says, "Now may not be the best time, but I've got someone I'd like to introduce you to." 

  

He has a container of precious metal jacks and throws them to the possum knight. Worm explains there have been earthquakes and vampire problems. 

  

Jenny G wants to talk to Worm (both person and worm) about JellyLife. Idsovak want to feel his material so to speak. There are more people on the PB then the entirety of the Valley of the Cats. Cats are sovereign citizens and there are a fuck-ton of them. 

  

Side note: Violet City cats are special (they have human hands, or snakes for tails). They can talk and are bonded with human familiar to attends to them. The cats in the valley are more or less regular ass cats. We're confused by their mundane nature. There's something off about the Cats out here. The Catriarch is a caretaker here and aids in cultural interpretation. The Catriarch needs to head to the house. Worm pokes the worm with the stick and prods it and is a little rougher like a farm hand. The worm stretches out and forms a bridge to the Pspspsps house. The worm is creepy and can flatten its body to better be walked on. The Catriarch says to join him later. 

  

There is a man actively making cat bags (like Cat-pi-suns). He sees us looking at him and he points down to the cat and says, "Sustainably sourced". He has a live snake in his hat. He is the EthicalCatJuicer. 

  

Mongag wants to talk to the EthicalCatJuicer

  

Worm pulls Nopal aside. Idsovak joins me. 

  

Mongag pulls out his gun wand so he can talk to it. He asks Ostrander what he should say. "Focus on them, ask them about their interests". The finished cats are hanging from the rafters. He puts like a box/bag/seed pouch to stretch the cats. 

M: Your work is amazing. I wish I could do what you do.

ECJ: You wanna see how it works.

  

ECJ pisses in the cat. He puts a finger over his lips and shhs. He pulls the snake out squeezes a bit of venom from the snake into the mix. 

ECJ: Then we're done. --chef's kiss

Would you like some?

I don't consume... well everything.

Well they make a great gift. 

He offers him one. Mongag asks for an unmade one that's ready.

You mean... a cat?

No, one that's been prepped so he can make one. 

In the back there is a rack of dead hollowed out cats. Do you have a white one... there's a pinkish one. Fucking vampires right...

He hands him a really nice tabby... check it out... he points the feet... polydactyl (more than the normal amount of toes). 

  

Scab & Jenny G follow the Catriarch to Pspspsps. He is sweeping little bits of cat litter/grit from around the house. The house is a prefabricated building. It is manufactured by a Cogflower subsidiary. Made of aircrete. Lighter stone and someone can carry it until you water it and it will set. ("Set it and Wet it" is their slogan). The house is what's on top of the head, the stray titan is what is below. The Catriarch welcomes them. Jenny kind of knocks off a bit of it... built to last. The worm should've waterd this while I was gone.

  

Gaze into the depths of the cat's eye. After seeing the sombrero on the statue the Catriarch is pissed. He removes the hat. This is a museum of artifacts. Behold the artifacts of our predecessors. The cat's eye is the size of a pilates ball. He acts very mystical about the whole thing. This eye came from the golem below. It gazed upon the final days of the battle against the Elf-Touched. It is also a powerful scrying tool. Jenny G would like to try it. The Catriarch says, it may behoove us to scrye upon the horror we've unleashed upon the world. 

  

Concentrate on looking directly into the pupil. Jenny is looking at 1000 Fingers to see what's up with KaiGool. Jenny wants to touch it. As Jenny stares the pupil continues to dilate and it's like he falls into it.

  

Thousand Fingers fights desperately for its own survival. Remaining people band together and fight. 3 landmarks have been destroyed.

-   Rock of Exiles... they're blowing slime whistles, it's like it attracts them. It spashes down on it. It's legs jellify and consumes all.
    
-   God to Be - there's a bunch of loot up there. It swipes all of it into its maw. It tears the whole pillar apart trying to get every piece of treasure.
    

-   The KaiGool is bedazzled and glittery now
    

-   The Nightmouth Clanhold - There is an organized attack coming from here. Teeth guns, like eXistenZ. 
    

-   New power is revealed from kaigool. It unleashes a breath weapon of infectious nanites. Great a giant monster and a nanitious pandemic. It is a glittery purple cloud that merges everything and melts it. 
    

-   Ultimately a makeshift navy of water taxis organized by the Slaam that makes it retreat (to the East). The ruins left are now called The Broken Fingers, surviving citizens are more unified than ever under their new leader (captain) The Slaam.
    
-   The Hagiographer is able to record the battle and a skintern escapes with the story before the Hagiographer himself succumbs to his wounds. 
    
-   A morbid take away, the Slime Whistle got the Kaigool's attention.
    

  

What is the story of the Stray Titan:

-   This was a producyt of the cats of the violet city in their emminence showing off their injinuity and genius they developed this Titan. It was crewed by the bravest and smartest of cats to do battle (to blunt the final assualt) of the elf touched. (Elf touched were thought to have been responsible for the zombie wars). This area was to have contained a portal where the elfs would come through in their monstrous form. The Titan destroyed the portal. 
    

-   If you look out the window you can see the sun glinteing off the oculus of the hilt of Dog Cutter, wielded by the Titan. There are pictures of the cats all about (you can only see necks of humans, never their faces). They're named cat names like Boots and Fluffy. As the Catriarch motions to the cats, the true tragedy is that these brave warriors sacrificed their cathood, their legacy (their descendents have become mundane)
    

-   The Catriarch is here to raise awareness of the Cats sacrifice and the importance of this battle fields (as opposed to the more popular choices of Golo and Sky bridge).
    
-   Jenny uses his Sidu of the Outcast `C!` Something doesn't seem right about this. It doesn't add up.
    

-   The Cat is different from everyone else... what the fuck is up with it? You're a pretty unique cat, what's your deal. The Catriarch is really evasive. Well, it's complicated. I'm not from the Violet City. I took a different path and it doesn't elaborate. 
    
-   This place also seems really quite old. A forgotten battlefield. 
    
-   Jenny G can feel the vibrations up through his feet. There is a giant hatch on the floor that's welded shut. There's no way into the Titan from here, but it's very dangerous, it's infested with vampires. There is a brood of degenerate vampires that feed on the cats. They're repulsive and primitive. 
    
-   The Worm was a great vampire slayer.
    
-   Scab asks about the hum. It responds, it's the wind and starts rambling and skirting the issue.
    

  

Nopal/Idsovak talk to Worm:

-   Knight is T-totaller and Possum is a drunk
    
-   The bar is crater with a pond within it that the lines are going in to.
    
-   There is a hand written sign with the name: The Cat's Crater
    
-   Worm is also the bartender. He pulls the tap and nothing, then a puff of smoke, then it's all foam, but it comes out like it's pancake batter. The possum gets a giant mortar shell filled with his shit. He goes off by himself. 
    
-   Worm tells us, he's a bit of a peacekeepr, innkeeper, groundskeeper, matchmaker, vampire hunter, and a fixer of sorts. He implies something to Nopal, that he doesn't pick up on. The Possum is ignoring us, pointedly. 
    
-   Worm gets down to brass tacks: He unrolls a map of the map of a location around the valley. main trade routes and whatnot and on the perifery other locations. He's got a bunch of places circled. He calls Nopal "Sir". Based on the exacting requirements. I think we may have 3 points of interest you might be intersted. All 3 are related to Golems. 
    
-   That right there is the steel flea. A Vek Tank (old world). Real sophisticated. Not entirely inanimate. 
    
-   Next is a dashed line... this is the patrol route of the old guard. A warframe that fought in this battle here. The last we know of that's functional. Very dangerous but intact.
    
-   Lastly is a mine. That's the Hell Hole. If you want flavor crystals that's where we go. It's been booby trapped and not cleared out. The crystals are as big as your torso. 
    
-   Id starts to butt in to get more info. Worm questions who she is and Nopal says she's his associate. She knows a bunch about Veks (has a skill... look it up). These things used to have human pilots but also had a low level animal intelligence so they could operate if their human was hurt. "We believe those environmental seals are still in tact." Perhaps the remains of one these drivers is still inside. 
    
-   Id asks if the Titan is a Vek? Its unknown. Probably something inbetween a golem and a vek. Can only date it back to the war years, but there's no record of this kind of thing. 
    

-   NOTE: A Golem is autonomous, A Vek is like a smart car, has a pilot but can do things on its own.
    
-   Worm is a hereditary freedom fighter. HE used to work on the Colossi around the Red Lands (very south of the circle sea). It is protected by half buried Golems with crazy ass eye beams. Whoever controlled the city could be protected. He sabotaged then to turn the tide for freedom fighters to take the Red City back. 
    
-   He got sick of the politics and came out East. Don't mind the isolation. The worm seems to like it too.
    

-   The Worm is an ash serpent. He's been a good mount and buddy to Worm for a long time. We've seen some shit haven't we.
    
-   Nopal knows this: Spirit Forge has oceans of ash and these fellas live there. Normally they're gray, this one is purple.
    

-   Where did he get his hardware?
    

-   Redlands specializes in hardware/weapons, but there's some custom shit in there.
    
-   Mongag was a Redlands resistance agent. So he fought against those dudes. 
    
-   Mongag recognizes the hardware as "freedom fighter". The claws wear common for infiltration and hand to hand combat. It's an old style of hardware, like a lost art.
    
-   His staff is anti-vampire. 
    
-   Mongag split because of this connection
    

-   Once upon a time there was a line/room of Mongags. 
    

-   Exclusive Event for God To Be
