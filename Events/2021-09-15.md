Grosnic is addicted to Hero, the soul excretions of the brave. When he snorted his first dose he remembered standing on the lip of a flying machine looking over the sands. There were thousands of people below cheering his name. 

  

Each party will choose one rumor to follow up on.

Rohaus and Mendel: Stolen nightmare portrait OR Hidden flaw in Burnt End prison?

Grosnic: Location of a secret oasis in the timeless dunes OR House of Plenty’s secret plan to defeat the separatists 

Siljak and Danton: The separatists plan OR Secret of the banded bandit king that is plaguing the road to cloud hendge. 

  

Tessana has a contact in Nightmare burger. Artists from N.B. are transported in sarcophagi that are never opened as they pass through Golo. If they can make contact with Nightmare Burger Queen. then they will secure a pipeline. 

  

A member of the cult of secret eating, the eater of names, takes an audience with Grosnic. They all wear visors so they cannot identify each other. Then he is introduced to the being. They have a digestive enhancement prosthetic. They cut off pieces of themselves to offer to be eaten.

The Eater of Names

  

Idle hands or Idolatry 

  

Hidden Flaw in Burnt End Prison - The structural integrity of Burnt End is not so good. A well placed charge or fleshification of some of the stone could cause the entire spire to fall into the energy seas. 

  

End of session:

-   New discovery? Negative
    
-   New weird shit? Yes
    
-   Grow Drug Empire? Yes
