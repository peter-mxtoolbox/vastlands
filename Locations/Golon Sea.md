Situtated on the western edge of the [[Yellow Wastes]], the Golon Sea is vast expanse of electric energy. Simultaenously bottomless and topless, it extends seemingly forever in either direction in a neon pink sky, with occassional lattices of white lightning in the distance. Floating throughout the Golon Sea are scabs of earth known as  [[aeroliths]]. Not many know how **stuck force** keeps them in the air, but it doesn't mean that it keeps them from moving. Sometimes they shift and the invisible roads that connect them shift along with them. Some believe that stuck force is like a web and there is a mathematical logic behind the connections between the aeroliths and their movements can be predicted, but those scholars are yet to published their findings.
