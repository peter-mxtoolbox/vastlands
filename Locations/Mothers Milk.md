The nightclub and residence of [[Bozin Black]].

It's a milk bar/entertainment venue. More frou frou then seedy, though tastes vary. There are private aparatments for the proprietor. The milk comes from the wall because the cocktrice has made the walls flesh. Each booth has its own teet.

The entrance way surrounded by a giant statue of a woman with a large bosom. Her arms are cradling the doors like a mother would a suckling infant. 

Upstairs the door to the private quarters are protected by a motion detecting sentry weapon. Its appearance is that of a nautilus shell with a flared barrel. It shoots porcelin projectiles that shatter upon impact. There is a rovering eye attached it to detect movement. It sits above set of double doors. Each door is a giant breast. When one pushes on the breast to open the door, it gives like flesh.

Hanging behind his desk is a veiled portrait. Presumably it is a [[Nightmare Portrait]].

Following the [[Revolution of Golo]], the place was ransacked and "Coward" had been scrawled on the wall behind the stage. With the changes in [[Golo]]'s integrity, the walls had begun to sweat milk causing the place to become a milky swamp.
