Originally mentioned in session [[2021-09-01 Arrival In Golo]]. A merchant told [[Danton]] his scarabs originated from here.

He said:Â **"It is a Wayshrine and death works differently there. People who are very much alive are deemed dead. And if you do die, they mock you and your memory. Those deemed dead are just ignored."**

* The scarabs are like psychopomps (those that take you from the living to the dead)
* It is an insect town.
