Under a black sky is a vast landscape of luminous silver sand. Beyond the sand is viscous black still water that appears to reflect stars that are not present. The sky is completely dark with no stars or moon, however, the sand is quite luminous. 

The beach is densly packed with bones and scuttling about are [[Black Crab]]s. They appear to respond to an unseen force guiding them in an organized fashion over distant dunes beyond the horizon.

There is a thrum beneath the sand. When a [[Black Crab]] emits the sonic death slurp, the source of the sound appears to be the thrum and the crab is just amplifying it.

The [[Wandering Grub Merchant]] can sometimes be found wandering the beach, ready to trade his wares.
