Initially owned by [[Celazome|The Dentist]], it was carried by skeletons and controlled by a "rod of command". 

Eventually the skeletons are given to [[The Barista]] and replaced by [[Courtesans]]. The palanquin is then used to transport [[Preggy Lee]] into [[Golo]]. Following the [[Revolution of Golo]], the palanquin is now the center piece of the [[Courtesans]] new restaurant, Palanquin (pronounced puh-lane-quinn).
