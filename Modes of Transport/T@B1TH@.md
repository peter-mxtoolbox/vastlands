A baba-yaga style building - it’s about the size of a shed and is on mechanical chicken legs.

The movement of the shack involves a NordicTrac style device inside. It isn’t actually connected to anything, T@B1TH@ just likes to feel like she’s being driven. Aside from the NordicTrac, the interior of T@B1TH@ is a featureless cube but there are fleshy bits… sometimes they get goosebumps.
