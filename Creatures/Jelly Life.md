### Jelly Life is Best Life

##### Jelly Life is...
* Austere. You don’t have to eat. Eating and preparing food is disgusting. 
- Open and honest. You can literally see right through each other. There is no deception. (Ken is making notes about how to make corporate life more like Jelly-life).
- Strong. Bones are a liability. Live a no-bone life. They make you ridgid… be relaxed. That’s why they crush the skulls.
* Verile... they are the dominant species

In summation:
Jelly is strong, Jelly is open and honest, Jelly is Verile, Jelly never hungers, Jelly is austere
